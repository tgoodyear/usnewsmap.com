# Web app

The US News Map single-page app ([design doc 07](../docs/design/07-frontend-design.md)). It uses React 19, TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre GL, deck.gl and TanStack Query. The API app serves it from its image, on the same origin as `/v1` ([ADR-0010](../docs/design/adr/0010-site-served-by-the-api.md)).

## Develop

Start the API on the synthetic fixtures, then the dev server, which proxies `/v1` to the API:

```sh
cargo run -p usnm-api            # from the repo root; serves :8080
cd web && npm ci && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173
```

| Script | What |
|--------|------|
| `npm run lint` / `typecheck` / `test` | ESLint, `tsc`, Vitest unit tests (engine, URL state, dates, snippets) |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/`. The API image also runs `node scripts/precompress.mjs dist` for brotli and gzip copies |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests with axe accessibility checks. By default against `vite preview` and a running API. With `PW_BASE_URL` (as CI does), against an API serving the build (`USNM_SITE_DIR=web/dist cargo run -p usnm-api`). Set `PW_CHROMIUM_PATH` to use an existing Chromium |

Build-time settings:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `VITE_API_BASE` | same origin | API origin. Production leaves it empty: the API serves the site |
| `VITE_BASEMAP_STYLE` | OpenFreeMap Positron | MapLibre style URL. `none` gives a plain background (offline and tests). The self-hosted PMTiles style replaces the default once the tiles are published |
| `VITE_PAGE_VIEWS` | unset | `1` sends page views from any origin (to try `POST /v1/beacon` against a local API), `0` never. Unset, only a production build on `https://usnewsmap.com` sends them |
| `USNM_API_ORIGIN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | API the dev and preview servers proxy `/v1` to |

## How it works

- **The URL is the state** (`src/state/url.ts`). Query, dates, scrubber position, window, layer, measure, selected place, tab and viewport are all in the URL. Only non-default values are written, and every parameter is validated when the URL is parsed.
- **One aggregate request per search.** `src/engine/cube.ts` builds per-place prefix sums from the sparse cube, so each playback frame, cumulative or trailing window, is a subtraction per place. Relative frequency uses the coverage cube named by `baseline_ref`, aligned to the same places.
- **Relative rate** (`norm=skew`, [doc 11](../docs/design/11-term-geographic-skew.md)). `src/engine/skew.ts` ports the Rust scoring (`usnm_core::skew`); `src/engine/skewModel.ts` fits a search once, in a web worker (`skew.worker.ts`), and scores each playback frame from prefix sums. `src/engine/skew.test.ts` checks the port against `fixtures/skew-vectors.json`, which `cargo test -p usnm-core --test skew_vectors` checks (and rewrites with `UPDATE_SKEW_VECTORS=1`). Older `norm=rel` permalinks still open the share-of-pages view.
- **Version pinning.** Every request carries the `v` from `/v1/meta`, so a whole session reads one published snapshot.
- **Snippets** are split into text and `<mark>` segments and rendered as text nodes. No API HTML is ever injected.
- **Accessibility.** A Table tab mirrors the map. Playback works from the keyboard: `Space`, `←`/`→` (`Shift` for 10), `Home`/`End`. The current date is announced in a live region. Reduced motion is honored. Without WebGL2, the table is shown instead of the map.
- **Page views** (`src/pageview.ts`, 07 §7.8). One per page load, sent with `navigator.sendBeacon` to `/v1/beacon`: the page name and title, and on the first page the referrer's origin and the landing URL's `utm_*` tags. Never the search or other query parameters. Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control turn it off, and nothing is stored in the browser. The privacy page (`/privacy`) describes it for visitors.
- **Performance.** The map stack is lazy-loaded; the critical-path JS is about 98 KB gzip (budget 250 KB).

Not yet built: compare mode, the first-appearance and state-choropleth layers, the coverage overlay, embed mode, export, and the share dialog beyond copying the link.

## Search engines and link previews

- `index.html` has the canonical link (the home page), Open Graph and Twitter card tags, and JSON-LD for the site and its publisher. `src/seo.test.ts` checks them, and `e2e/seo.spec.ts` checks them in a browser along with what the API sends crawlers.
- The root element holds a short description of the site, for crawlers and previews that don't run JavaScript. React replaces it on its first render.
- `public/og-image.png` is the share image, a 1200×630 screenshot of the "Cross of Gold, 1896" example on the live site.
- `public/robots.txt` tells crawlers not to fetch `/v1/`, and `public/sitemap.xml` lists the home page and `/privacy`. Search permalinks and `/status` are left out, since the API marks them `noindex`. The API serves `/privacy` with its own title, canonical link and `og:url`.
- `public/<key>.txt` is the IndexNow key. After each production deploy, CI submits the sitemap's URLs to IndexNow (`scripts/ci/indexnow.sh`). A failed submission is logged as a warning and never fails the deploy.
