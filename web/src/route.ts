/**
 * The page for a path. The app has no router: `/` is the search, `/datasets`
 * the dataset details, `/privacy` the privacy notice, `/credits` the OCR credits, and anything else not
 * found. The API answers the same paths with 200 and the rest with 404
 * (`is_app_page` in crates/usnm-api/src/site.rs). `/index.html` is the home
 * page's file, which the API serves with a 200, with or without a trailing
 * slash. `/status`, the dataset details' old path, is redirected to
 * `/datasets` by the API; the app shows the same page there too, for a
 * server that doesn't redirect (the dev server). The page names are also the
 * routes `/v1/beacon` accepts (`ROUTES` in crates/usnm-api/src/routes/beacon.rs).
