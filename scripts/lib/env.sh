# - private ones (addresses, principals, resource ids) in the settings

#   subscription (scripts/settings-store.sh; its endpoint is the local
#   SETTINGS_STORE_ENDPOINT), under the environment's label, which provision
#   reads with the operator's sign-in (load_store); until it exists, they
#   stay in the local file, and --migrate then moves them;
# - everything else in the local file: the stack's outputs, the
#   subscription and tenant, and what the scripts keep (local in the
#   schema). KEY="value" lines (the layout azd used, so older environments
#   carry over) in $USNM_SETTINGS_HOME/<env>/.env (default
