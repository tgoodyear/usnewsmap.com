# The share of searches by date span and by decade partitions touched (#123),
# for scripts/azure/searches.sh. Input: the array of search-log records
# (crates/usnm-api/src/searchlog.rs). `--arg by span` counts by date span,
# `--arg by decades` by partitions touched. Output: tab-separated rows of
# aggregates only: no query text ever reaches it.
#
# "Whole range" (the site's default) compares a record's `from` and `to`, which
# the API clamps to the corpus, with the corpus bounds in `--argjson bounds`:
# `{"news": {"from", "to"}, "congress": {"from", "to"}}`, from the site's
# /v1/meta (searches.sh). A search from at or before the bounds' `from` to at
# or after their `to` is whole range. A corpus with no bounds given (none
# passed, or a corpus meta doesn't list) falls back to the earliest `from` and
# latest `to` among its records of the same index version, which overcounts
# whole range when no one searched the whole range: searches.sh says so when
# it falls back. Spans count inclusive days: "a
# year or less" is up to 366 days (one calendar year), "1-10 years" up to
# 3,653 (one calendar decade).
#
# Partitions are bucketed as usnm_core::decade::of_year: one per decade from
# 1820, with every year before 1820 in the 1820 partition.

# Days since 1970-01-01 of a YYYY-MM-DD date (proleptic Gregorian), without
# the platform's mktime, which not every jq handles before 1970.
