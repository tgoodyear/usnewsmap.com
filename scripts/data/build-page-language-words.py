"""Export the function words a page's language is found by (#289, 05
§5.5.8): crates/usnm-core/data/page-language-words.txt.

    scripts/data/build-page-language-words.py [--out path] [--check]

Needs wordfreq 3.1.1 (`pip install wordfreq==3.1.1`, the version the OCR
audit pins in ja-ocr/requirements.txt).

The lists come from the audit's own code, so they can't drift from it:
`damage_v2.Models` (what `quality.py --metric v2` uses) builds each word
list's model, and its function words are written out. For each list (the
wordfreq codes in `damage_v2.WORDFREQ`, where Croatian and Serbian share
`sh`, and our own Hawaiian and Yiddish lists), that is its 100 most
frequent words of 2 letters or more, most frequent first, then for Danish
and Norwegian their `aa` spellings (`paa` for `på`). One line per list:
the code, the script of its words, then the words, separated by spaces.

`usnm_core::page_language` embeds the file. Nothing in the pipeline runs
this script. `--check` compares with the committed file instead of writing
it (exit 1 when it differs or is missing); the Japanese OCR image's tests
run it (ja-ocr/test_page_language_parity.py).
