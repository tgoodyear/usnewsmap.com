# Reads up to five lines from stdin. The first three are the onboarding
# service principal: tenant id, app id, secret. onboard.sh makes that
# principal for the run, with only Azure Connected Machine Onboarding on the
# group, and deletes it after. The secret never goes on a command line or to
# persistent disk: it waits in a 0600 file under /run (tmpfs) while
# `azcmagent connect --config` reads it, and is deleted straight after. A
# node that's already connected needs none (three empty lines). The next two
# are, on RHEL, the Red Hat organization id and activation key, which
# onboard.sh reads from the nodes' Key Vault; they stay in this script's
# memory, never on disk. RHEL is registered first, before anything is
# installed, since its repositories need it; a registered node needs neither.
#
# On RHEL, registers with Red Hat (skipped if registered) and enables
# BaseOS, AppStream and CodeReady Builder (for EPEL).
# Keeps the journal on disk; installs python3, podman, chrony, cron and
# rsyslog, and htop, iftop and screen from EPEL; turns on dnf-automatic,
# which installs every update daily and never reboots, and a weekly reboot
# window (usnm-ocr-reboot.timer, 04:00 US Eastern on --reboot-day) that
# reboots only when an update needs it, after stopping the worker;
# creates the `usnm` system user; sets up the engine runtime of ADR-0016
# (13 §13.3): the engine account `usnmeng` with lingering, subordinate ids
# and cgroup delegation, its Podman API socket at
# /run/usnm-ocr/podman.sock shared with usnm through the group `usnmocr`,
# and the engines' scratch, a tmpfs of --scratch-size (default 2G) at
# /run/usnm-ocr/scratch; installs the Azure Connected Machine
# agent and, BEFORE it connects, locks it down: no extension but the Azure
# Monitor Linux Agent (it stops if any other is installed), no guest
# configuration, no incoming connections;
# connects; installs the worker's systemd unit (usnm-ocr-worker.service,
# copied beside this script) disabled, and its settings in
# /etc/usnm/ocr-worker.env (the exchange account's URLs, the node id and
# the connection string of the nodes' own Application Insights component,
# usnm-ocr-appi-<env>, which isn't a secret: with local auth off, ingestion
# needs an Entra token too) unless install-worker.sh has written them; and
# checks that `usnm` can get a token from the agent. The unit starts only
# once scripts/ocr-node/install-worker.sh has put the worker binary in
# /usr/local/bin. onboard.sh installs the monitoring
# agent itself, from Azure, after this. Safe to run again, on a connected
# node too: it applies the lockdown and the unit as they are now.
#
# The node mounts nothing from pve-big: the worker reads prefetched scans
# from the scan server over HTTP (#368, ADR-0015 decision 9). A mount at
# /srv/ocr-data left by an earlier version of this script is removed.
