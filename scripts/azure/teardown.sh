# Delete one usnewsmap environment: its deployment stack with every resource
# and resource group it manages, and its GitHub Environment (08 §8.9). The
# last environment in a subscription also takes the guard-rail stack, unless
# the archival account (usnm-archive) still assigns it. The data goes with
# it (a new environment rebuilds it from LoC). Its settings file
# (scripts/lib/env.sh) is kept, renamed .env.deleted-<time>, without its
# experiment marker, for scripts/azure/stand-up.sh to start from, and so are its
# private settings in the settings store (under its label), which the
# store's own stack (usnm-config) keeps.
#
# An environment that uses the archival account (USNM_ARCHIVE_ACCOUNT) is
# first detached from it: the account's delete lock is lifted, the
# environment is provisioned without the setting and without the search
# cluster (the settings that grant it roles there), the account is checked
# for anything of the environment's left behind, and the lock is put back
# (scripts/azure/archive-store.sh deploy), whether or not those steps succeed. The
# account and its data are never changed (#275).
#
#   scripts/azure/teardown.sh --env NAME [--subscription ID] [--repo OWNER/NAME]
#     [--allow-rename=<exact-old-name>]...
#
# Archive detachment provisions without the search cluster, which can
# remove protected NFS scratch storage and its file private-DNS zone.
# Approve each such removal explicitly with --allow-rename, just as for
# provision.sh. The environment-name confirmation is not a guard bypass;
# incomplete/failed plans cannot be approved.
#
# The subscription defaults to the environment's own (from its settings).
# Passing another --subscription removes the copy left there after a move:
# only its Azure resources, since the GitHub Environment, the deploy list
# and the settings belong to the live copy. Don't run bootstrap for the same
# environment while this runs.
#
# Needs: az 2.61+ and gh, signed in, Owner on the subscription and admin on
# the repository. Asks for the environment's name before deleting anything.
