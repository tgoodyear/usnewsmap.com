# Start an environment's title records and catalog from the newest copy in
# the archival account (`raw/titles/{time}.json`, which titles-sync saves
# there after each run), so a release in a new environment doesn't wait for
# a titles-sync paced against LoC (up to 8 hours). #275; docs/operations.md,
# "Dev environment lifecycle". scripts/azure/stand-up.sh runs it.

#
# It starts one execution of the environment's ingest job running
# `usnm-ingest titles-seed` (scripts/azure/start-job.sh) and waits for it. The job
# reaches the archival account through the environment's private endpoint,
# as curation does, with the ingest identity's existing role there (list,
# read and create in `raw`); nothing here reads the account directly. The
# seed writes only into an environment with no record cache
# (`reference/raw/titles.json`), each file create-only: a cache the
# environment already has, newer or older, is never replaced. The job logs
# the copy it read and the files it wrote or kept:
# scripts/azure/logs.sh --env NAME --query-name titles-archive.
#
# Needs USNM_ARCHIVE_ACCOUNT and the ingest job (USNM_INGEST_JOBS with
# USNM_USE_ACR) in the environment's settings, az signed in to its
# subscription, and jq.
