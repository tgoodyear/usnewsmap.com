"""Time a few known-slow searches, cold then warm, one request at a time.

    scripts/bench-cold-searches.py [base-url]    (default https://usnewsmap.com)

For each search it asks /v1/aggregate as the web app does, waits out each
`202 Accepted` for its Retry-After (06 §6.3.5), and records the time to the
result and the backend time the API reports (`timing_ms.backend`, which is
the time of the computation that produced the body, even when the body now
comes from a cache). Then it asks once more for the same search, which the
API now answers from its in-process cache. That is one pass. Run it once
against production, not in a loop; the numbers are for deciding whether
the searcher needs more compute or a split cache.

"Cold" means not in the API's caches when the pass starts. A search that a
visitor or an earlier pass already ran may be in the persistent cache
(kept for the index version's lifetime) or warm in Quickwit's own caches,
and then comes back fast: when the first answer took under 1 s with no 202,
the first column adds "cached" (a guess).

These requests are not in the search log: the API records a search only
when the request comes from the site's own pages (an Origin of the site or
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin) and from a browser, and this script sends
neither header and a script's user agent (`admit` in
crates/usnm-api/src/searchlog.rs). They do show in request telemetry.
