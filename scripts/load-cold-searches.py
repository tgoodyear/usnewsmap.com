"""Run cold searches at rising concurrency and report how the API copes.

    scripts/load-cold-searches.py [base-url] [--levels 1,2,4,10] [--pause 30] [-v]

The default base URL is http://localhost:8080. Run it against staging; run it
against production only at a quiet hour, once, since every search it sends
is a cold one that the searcher must compute in full.

The same ten searches, a mix of the benchmark classes in 05 §5.8 (rare
phrase, mid-frequency term, high-frequency term, proximity, filtered), run
once per concurrency level: a pool of N workers drains the ten. Each request
waits out `202 Accepted` and `503 busy` as the web app does (06 §6.3.5), so
the time to a result includes any time queued for a computation slot.

"Cold" means cold for the API: every pass shifts each search's date window
back by one more day, so the canonical request, and with it the cache key,
is new each time, and neither the in-process nor the persistent cache can
answer it. The shift keeps a window's length (a whole-corpus window loses
its last days, since the API clamps dates to the corpus), so every pass
searches the same workload. The whole run starts from a random offset of up
to 90 days (`--offset` sets it), so a second run doesn't meet the first
run's cached results. Quickwit's own caches
are a different matter: split footers and fast fields stay warm across
passes. So the first pass, at concurrency 1, is reported apart as "first"
(the searcher's cold start); the levels after it, including another pass at
concurrency 1, share the same warm-searcher conditions and compare fairly.
Each search the script runs leaves an entry in the persistent response cache
for this index version.

How to read the result: `speedup` is a level's throughput (searches per
second) over the concurrency-1 pass. When a cold search mostly waits on Blob
reads, running more at once overlaps that waiting, and speedup grows with
concurrency up to the API's slots (`USNM_COMPUTE_CONCURRENCY`); raising
the slot count would then help. When it mostly computes, speedup stops near
the searcher's vCPU count (2), and only more CPU, or cheaper searches,
helps. `ahead` is the most searches the API reported queued ahead of one of
ours; `busy` counts `503 busy` answers (a full queue), which the script
waits out like the web app.

The API rate-limits each client address (120 requests a minute, bursts of
40, by default); the script pauses between levels. Like the web app, it
waits out a `429` met while waiting on a search (counted in `429s`), and
counts one on a search's first request as that search failing. Its requests are not in the search log: they send
no Origin or Sec-Fetch-Site header and a script's user agent (`admit` in
crates/usnm-api/src/searchlog.rs). They do show in request telemetry.
