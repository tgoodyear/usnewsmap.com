# Which parts of CI a change needs, as step outputs rust/web/image/e2e/fixtures/
# ops/code/markdown/ocr_worker/page_language=true|false (ocr_worker: the OCR
# worker's EL9 build, its Tesseract image and, on main, its release;
# page_language: the page-language detector's test on text of known
# language; code: anything but
# documentation changed, so the infrastructure checks and the shared-key scan run; markdown: a Markdown
# file changed, so Prettier checks its format), and provision=true|false:
# whether it changes the Azure stack beyond what a deploy applies (the API
# image and infra/quickwit/searcher.yaml, which scripts/ci/roll-api.sh
# applies), so scripts/provision.sh must run. Documentation (Markdown
# anywhere, anything under docs/) counts for no output but markdown: a change
# to it alone runs only the Markdown format check.
# ocr_gold: the OCR gold set (scripts/ocr-survey/, fixtures/ocr-gold/, and the
# Rust scorer's golden files that gold.py writes), whose unit tests and golden
# check run in the infra job. Most fixtures/ocr-gold/ files count for none
# of rust/quickwit/web/image/fixtures. The v1 lock is embedded in the Rust
# mirror CLI, and it and reviewed selections also build the bridge.
# boinc_pages: the BOINC project's own web pages (contrib-compute/boinc/html/), which
# only need a PHP syntax check; a change to them alone runs nothing else.
# contrib: the hosting for the stock BOINC server (contrib-compute/: shell,
# XML and Bicep; ADR-0019), which no other job builds.
# Everything runs for a default workflow_dispatch (scripts/bootstrap.sh dispatches ci
# to publish images), for a change to the workflows themselves, and whenever
# the changed files can't be worked out; everything but ops, which runs only
# when its own files change (the snapshots, the index history, their schemas,
# checkers and writers, its requirements, or ci.yml, which defines the job).
# quickwit: what the Quickwit job's two tests build or load: the workspace
# crates usnm-search and usnm-ingest depend on (from cargo metadata), the
# workspace manifest and lock file only when the packages Cargo resolves for
# those crates change, and the fixtures, index configs and Quickwit scripts.
# image and e2e are narrowed the same way: image for the workspace crates
# usnm-api (Dockerfile) and usnm-ingest (Dockerfile.ingest) build, e2e (the web
# end-to-end job) for those usnm-api builds, the API that
# scripts/ci/start-api-fixtures.sh starts. A crate outside a closure (the BOINC
# or OCR survey crates, say) runs neither.
# The infra job (code) checks the workbook definitions, so any change to
# infra/workbooks/ runs it; infra/workbooks/boinc.json, which the BOINC stack
# loads, also runs contrib, which builds that stack.
