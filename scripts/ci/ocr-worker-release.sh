The OCR worker binary (#296) for AlmaLinux 9 and RHEL 10 (x86_64, glibc 2.34 or later), built from $GITHUB_SHA.

- \`usnm-ocr-worker\`: the worker binary.
- \`usnm-ocrdash\`: the dashboard executable; deploy it using your infrastructure tooling.
- \`usnm-ocr-tesseract.oci.tar.gz\`: the Tesseract image it runs (\`ocr/engines/tesseract/\`), image id \`$image\`.
- \`usnm-ocr-tesseract.image-id\`: that id.
- \`SHA256SUMS\`: the sha256 of each file.

Each file has a build provenance attestation; verify it with \`gh attestation verify\` before installing. No node runs the binary as a direct queue worker: local OCR runs through BOINC only (#966).
