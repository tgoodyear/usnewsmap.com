#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Start one execution of an environment's Container Apps job with other
# arguments, keeping the job's image, settings and replicas, and print the
# execution's name.
#
#   scripts/start-job.sh dev INGEST_JOB enqueue --batches a_ver01,b_ver01
#   scripts/start-job.sh dev BACKFILL_JOB curate --max-runtime-secs 14400
#
# The second argument is the setting that names the job (INGEST_JOB,
# BACKFILL_JOB, ...: the stack's outputs). The rest replaces the first
# container's arguments; its command stays. `az containerapp job start
# --args` sends a container without the image or settings, so this copies
# the job's template and swaps only the arguments (as
# scripts/ja-ocr/start-quality.sh does). An execution's template has no
# volumes (the API's JobExecutionTemplate takes containers and init
# containers with image, command, args, env and resources only), so it
# can't name the job's volumes or mounts: use it for commands that don't
# need the ingest job's scratch share, such as enqueue, curate or
# archive-copy. Needs az signed in to the environment's subscription and jq.
