# Start one run of the BOINC bridge job (contrib-compute/images/server/bridge-job.sh) with its
# step and that step's settings, and print the execution's name:
#
#   scripts/start-boinc-bridge.sh --env prod --step register-apps
#   scripts/start-boinc-bridge.sh --env prod --step gold-prepare --var GOLD_CAMPAIGN=v1-tess550
#   scripts/start-boinc-bridge.sh --env prod --step submit --var JOB_ID=<id> --wait-mins 30
#
# Why not `az containerapp job start --env-vars`: with any container flag the CLI sends an
# execution template holding one container named after the job (this one is "bridge"), with
# no image, and with only the variables given, so the job's own settings (KEY_VAULT_NAME,
# DB_HOST, PROJECT_DIR, ...) are gone. The API's execution template also has no volumes or
# mounts (scripts/start-job.sh), and every step needs the project share at /project. So this
# script writes the run's settings into the job itself, with
# `az containerapp job update --replace-env-vars`: the job's settings that the template
# defines (BASE_VARS below, kept as they are) plus BRIDGE_STEP and each --var. Settings a
# previous run left are dropped. Then it starts the job with no override, so the image, the
# command, the resources and the share mount are the deployed ones. The next
# scripts/provision-boinc.sh puts the template's settings back.
#
# --var NAME=VALUE is repeatable; NAME is upper case and can't be one of BASE_VARS or
# BRIDGE_STEP. The step and the values are checked by bridge-job.sh, not here. --wait-mins N
# waits up to N minutes for the execution to succeed and exits 1 if it ends Failed, Stopped
# or Degraded or is still running then. --what-if prints the settings and changes nothing.
# One step at a time: a manual job can run several executions at once, and they would share
# the project tree and the database. So it refuses while any execution of the job is still
# running, and after the start it reads the new execution's settings back and fails if they
# are not this run's (another caller updated the job in between). That narrows the window
# but is no lock: one operator runs these steps.
# Needs az signed in to the settings' subscription, and jq.
