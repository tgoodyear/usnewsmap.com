# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so the approach can be agreed before you write the code.

The [design documents](docs/design/README.md) explain how the system works and why. If a change alters a decision recorded there, update the document or the [ADR](docs/design/adr/README.md) in the same pull request.

## Run the checks

CI runs the Rust checks when a pull request touches Rust code and the web checks when it touches the web app (`scripts/ci/changes.sh`). A pull request that only changes documentation (Markdown anywhere, or anything under `docs/`) runs none of this workflow's checks beyond the `changes` job itself; GitHub's CodeQL scan, configured in the repository settings, runs on every pull request. Run the ones that apply before you push:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked

cd web
npm ci
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The infrastructure checks, and the scan for shared keys, run on every pull request that changes anything other than Markdown or `docs/` (from the repository root):

```sh
scripts/ci/lint-bicep.sh
scripts/ci/no-shared-keys.sh
bicep build infra/main.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
bicep build infra/guardrails.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
AZURE_ENV_NAME=ci bicep build-params infra/main.bicepparam --stdout > /dev/null
```

`scripts/ci/install-bicep.sh` shows the Bicep version CI uses. The end-to-end tests are described in [`web/README.md`](web/README.md), and the Quickwit parity tests in the [README](README.md#against-quickwit).

## Rules

- **Entra ID only.** Every service signs in with a managed identity. Don't add account keys, SAS tokens, connection strings with keys or instrumentation keys ([ADR-0009](docs/design/adr/0009-entra-identity-only.md)). `scripts/ci/no-shared-keys.sh` fails the build if one appears.
- **No real data from production.** Never commit search log content or real search queries ([ADR-0012](docs/design/adr/0012-anonymous-search-log.md)), production logs, traces or data dumps. Tests use the synthetic corpus in `fixtures/`. `python3 fixtures/generate.py` rebuilds it, and CI checks that the result matches what is committed.
- **No secrets.** The repository holds none, and pull requests never get Azure access. Only `main` deploys, through its GitHub Environment.

## Pull requests

Keep each pull request to one change, and say what it changes and how you tested it. CI skips the jobs a change can't affect, so an infrastructure-only fix doesn't wait on the Rust and web builds.
