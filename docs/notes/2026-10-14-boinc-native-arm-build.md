## The question

Can Apple Silicon volunteers execute the existing science worker natively in
Podman, and can the repository supply the build and signed-release inputs without
hand-editing the Azure server? The BUDA evaluation remains separate in
[PR #503](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/pull/503).

## What we did

Built the repository's worker and fixture-generator build stage in a dedicated
ARM64 Podman VM on an Apple Silicon Mac. The VM used four CPUs and 8 GiB RAM;
`/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status` was `disabled` during the build and smoke test.
The build used the ARM Rust digest pinned in the workflow and the previously
built native Tesseract engine configuration ID
`sha256:626b866f8148178e65b9f511680f90f64ee90e308cdacd7c75eeec41398cf955`.
Tesseract 5.5.0 and the repository's model lock were unchanged.

The repeatable round trip was:

```sh
python3 boinc/scripts/smoke-worker.py --runtime /opt/podman/bin/podman \
  --image localhost/usnm-boinc-worker:arm64-pr \
  --build-image localhost/usnm-boinc-build:arm64-pr \
  --arch arm64 --dir /tmp/usnm-native-arm-pr/smoke
```

The script checks native image architectures, runs export, work and collect with
no network, a read-only container root and the worker's resource limits, rejects
a forged engine digest, and checks collection replay. The fixture generator runs
natively as well. The workflow runs the same test on native amd64 and arm64
Ubuntu runners before publishing a joint index. Hosted runs and index publication
were not executed locally.

Built both Mac wrappers using the repository script and upstream BOINC commit
`22bbebe08e2eaac5d5e88a6d93b88e800cb6341c`, matching the server source pin. Both
passed architecture and checksum checks. The ARM wrapper SHA-256 was
`8cb7f9f046f4c5355c4ce54b264a85c1c899f089496aec1b77e61e95cc48994c`.
An additional offline probe used that ARM wrapper through BOINC 8.2.15's installed
`Run_Podman` helper with Podman 5.5.2 and the earlier native worker recorded in
PR #503. Its derived image was prebuilt to bypass the standalone cold-build
heartbeat wait; this was not a scheduled BOINC job.

The Intel wrapper was compiled and checked, not executed. No private signing key,
server registration, scheduled job, upload, validator, assimilator or live bridge
was used. No published settings were changed.

## What is left

The maintainer must merge the build tooling, publish the tested worker index,
commit public digest settings, and use the [offline-signing release procedure](../../boinc/docs/app-release.md#mac-app-versions).
Then verify a reserved native Mac `usnm_ocr` job end to end, fix and retest
Podman pause and restart, test client restart and reboot, and establish native
gold-page agreement before closing #476. Gold and assessment expectations
currently hold one architecture-specific engine base ID; a multi-architecture
campaign requires matching expectations rather than reusing the amd64 ID for
arm64. The server-dependent BUDA evidence in #481 remains outstanding.
