# Rootless BOINC volunteer readiness on an SELinux host

**Status:** measured, contribution proposed · **Date:** October 2026 · **Measured on:** Linux x86-64, RHEL 10.2, SELinux enforcing, BOINC 8.2.13, Podman 5.8.2, cgroup v2 · **Code:** `scripts/boinc/setup_volunteer.py`, `scripts/boinc/volunteer_preflight.py`, [volunteer guide](../boinc-volunteer.md) · **Issues:** [#504](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/504), [#469](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/469), [#484](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/484)

## The question

Can a trusted volunteer attach a stock Linux BOINC client and rely on a container starting successfully to establish slot access, bounded resource use and idle-time pause? A live pilot showed that a successful container start was not enough. The client and the project's pinned wrapper both support Podman directly; Docker-group access was unnecessary.

## What we did

The stock wrapper binds the BOINC slot without a `:z`/`:Z` relabel option. On the enforcing host, container access to the original slot label failed. The worker's job-file existence check made this appear as a missing file. A `container_file_t` label scoped to the slots directory restored input and output access while SELinux remained enabled.

Podman also accepted the configured resource arguments without a usable container cgroup. Inspecting the OCI resource configuration initially overstated enforcement: actual kernel readings were unbounded, and pause failed with “cannot pause the container without a cgroup”. A BOINC user systemd session, Podman's systemd cgroup manager, and writable cgroups in the service restored limits and pause. The container remains rootless; no Docker socket or root-equivalent group is required.

The profile preserves runtime files through a service restart and places Podman's monitors with their containers. The client keeps apps in memory during suspension. The preflight runs in `ExecStartPre` as the service user and exercises the same task runtime policy against a disposable real slot. It adds no mount relabel option, reads the kernel cgroup files, checks read-only and no-network behavior, tests pause and resume, and removes only its own probe. A regression keeps its resource flags aligned with `ocr/boinc/job.toml`.

The installation helper was exercised with a separate stock BOINC service and empty, account-free data on the same host. A deliberate wrong slots label caused `ExecStartPre` to fail with no main-client start timestamp. Restoring the label allowed startup. Unit tests also simulate a runtime accepting flags while reporting unbounded limits; that cannot pass the gate.

The public gold bundle produced 90 scored crops and 52 skips for unavailable French, Finnish and Swedish models. Those counts establish local execution, not successful ingestion. Result-file uploads were separately rejected by the server for missing signatures, even though the scheduler received completion reports. Upload, validation and collection must be checked independently; they are outside this host-readiness contribution.

## What is left

Only the stated combination of RHEL, BOINC and Podman has live coverage. Debian, Ubuntu and other distributions need the same host probe, service-restart test and actual result acceptance by the client and server before wider enrollment. Keyboard-triggered idle behavior over a full idle interval, laptop sleep and OS reboot have not been verified by the manual pause and service-restart tests. The optional modern idle-detection helper remains a separate dependency to evaluate.

The preflight adds startup latency and depends on a cached or anonymously pullable pinned worker image. Re-run setup with the released image digest after draining tasks when the app image or runtime policy changes. It checks readiness at startup, not continuously while a task runs. Kernel or runtime updates still need a restart and a fresh probe. A future release test (#484) should run this host gate as well as require output upload, validation and assimilation.
