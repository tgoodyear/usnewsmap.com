# ADR-0016: Pluggable OCR engines behind one versioned contract

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10
- **Extends:** ADR-0004 (Rust) to the OCR pipeline, and ADR-0015 (on-prem OCR workers)
- **Amends:** ADR-0015 §6, which keeps Python for the engine survey: the survey's runner and scorer move to Rust. Python stays inside engine images whose engine is a Python library, in one-off sampling tools, in audits, and in the Japanese cloud job until that job runs through the contract.
- **Spec:** [13: OCR engines](../13-ocr-engines.md)
- **Related:** [12: On-prem OCR pipeline](../12-onprem-ocr-pipeline.md). 12 specifies the language code map, the damage metric in Rust, the worker's unit and install, the cloud pickup (`usnm-ingest ocr-sync`), the release and the seeder. This ADR and 13 use those pieces under 12's names.

## Context

**How Tesseract came first.** The language report's Fraktur plan ([`report.md`](../../reports/2026-10-language-analysis/report.md), #246) proposed running Tesseract's Fraktur German model (`deu_latf`) and its roman German model (`deu`) on about 1,000 German pages, to confirm the typeface and to serve as a pilot. The first draft of the worker (#298) carried that over, and Tesseract is its only engine. On main:

- `crates/usnm-ocr-worker/src/engine.rs` has an `Engine` trait with one implementation, `Tesseract`. It runs the `tesseract` CLI as one subprocess per page, with `--psm 3 --dpi 300` and the `txt` and `alto` configs.
- The trait takes a path on the host and a language, and returns text, ALTO and an `ocr_engine` string. An engine can only report `Unsupported` or `Failed`, and the worker leaves the message to reappear in both cases.
- `candidates()` hard-codes Tesseract model names per language. `--engine` accepts only `tesseract`, and the worker holds one engine.
- `ocr_source` is the literal `usnm-tesseract`. The stored ALTO is Tesseract's own file with only `fileName` changed.

**The survey grew its own harness.** The engine survey (#296) runs on node 1 and isn't in the repository yet. It runs each engine in its own podman container through a Python runner: Tesseract, docTR, Surya 2 and NDNP Open OCR, with American Stories being added. It has its own job and result formats, page ids and scoring, and its numbers don't describe what the worker would run:

- it runs Debian's Tesseract 5.5.0 without `--dpi 300`, which the worker passes;
- it scores the engines' raw text, not the `normalize_ocr` text the overlay stores;
- its page ids (`<lccn>_<date>_ed1_seq4`) aren't `doc_id`s (`<lccn>_<date>_ed-1_seq-4`);
- it measures resources from inside each container, under limits the worker wouldn't use.

**American Stories was missing.** The first engine list left out the pipeline Dell Research Harvard used to build the American Stories dataset from Chronicling America scans. Its text is already indexed alongside LoC's (#218), and it reads English only. But NDNP Open OCR reuses its layout model, and its legibility classifier may be a damage signal, so it is being added to the survey as a fifth container.

**What the engines look like.** The [engine catalog](../13-ocr-engines.md#1312-engine-catalog), fact-checked on 2026-10-10, covers close to 40 engines, pipelines and model servers. Four things follow from it:

- Only Tesseract, NDNP Open OCR and Kraken write ALTO, in three dialects: v3 in pixels, v3 in inch1200 at an assumed 300 dpi, and v4 in pixels with polygons. The others return word, line or block boxes, or no geometry at all.
- Most are Python libraries. Tesseract and Kraken have CLIs. American Stories' pipeline and NDLOCR-Lite are run today as scripts that load their models on every call. Most vision-language models can run behind llama.cpp's or vLLM's OpenAI-compatible servers.
- Four are Rust libraries: oar-ocr and ocrs, and the PP-OCR ports paddle-ocr-rs and ocr-rs. mistral.rs and Candle are Rust runtimes for vision-language models.
- Many are Apache-2.0, but some models come with terms that reach the published text (Surya 2's modified Open RAIL-M), some are research-only or non-commercial, and some have no licence at all.

**The rule of 2026-10-10.** The OCR pipeline is Rust wherever practical. An engine that is a Python library may keep a thin Python adapter, and a CLI engine gets a small Rust adapter. The contract between the worker and the adapters therefore has to be language-neutral.

**Gaps on main that the design has to close:**

- **Language codes.** The catalog stores MARC codes (`ger`, `cze`; `crates/usnm-core/src/names.rs`), or LoC's lower-cased name for a language not in its table (`pennsylvania german`). The worker expects ISO 639-3. Message validation only checks for three lower-case letters, so a `ger` message passes, routes to a Tesseract model named `ger`, and fails as `no_model` on every node until it is dead-lettered. 12 Steps 4 and 7 add the map and the check.
- **ALTO.** The only ALTO writer is Python (`ocr/ja-ocr/alto.py`, v3.1 in inch1200). The worker's only ALTO handling is a string replace of `fileName`.
- **Damage.** The damage metric exists only in Python (`ocr/ja-ocr/quality.py`). 12 Steps 4 to 6 port it to `usnm_core::damage`.
- **`loc_text`.** The worker writes the queue reason (`bulk` or `user`) there, and `usnm_ingest::ocr_ja` reads the column as LoC's failure class. Nothing reads `ocr-out` or `curated/ocr-local/` yet; 12 Steps 8 and 9 plan the pickup and the release's reader. Read through `ocr_ja::load`, a worker row with `loc_text = bulk` would count as indexable Japanese text.
- **The worker's unit can't run rootless podman.** `usnm-ocr-worker.service` runs as `usnm` and sets `PrivateDevices`, `ProtectKernelTunables`, `RestrictSUIDSGID`, `RestrictAddressFamilies` and similar options. systemd documents that, for a unit without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, these imply `NoNewPrivileges=yes`. Under no_new_privs, `newuidmap` can't use its file capabilities, so podman can't map the subordinate ids `node-setup.sh` gives `usnm`. The unit's comment assumes that leaving out `NoNewPrivileges=` is enough. `ProtectHome=yes` also hides `/run/user`, where rootless podman keeps its runtime state. 12 Step 2 moves the unit to `scripts/ocr-node/usnm-ocr-worker.service`.
- **Node 1** has 8 GB of memory, 2 cores and 4 threads, and no GPU, so engine instances have to share its memory under a budget.

## Decision

1. **One contract, `usnm-ocr-engine/1`.**
   - An engine adapter is the entrypoint of its engine's image. It speaks JSON lines on stdin and stdout. Once it is ready, it sends a `hello`: the engine and its version, every model file any of its profiles can load with its sha256, the profiles it offers with their languages, models and tunable options, and how it cancels a page that runs past its deadline. `engines.lock.json` keeps each image's whole `hello`, and the worker refuses an instance whose `hello` differs from it. After that it takes one `page` request at a time and answers each with one `result`.
   - Images and outputs go through files. The worker writes the scan, or its scaled copy or tiles, into a read-only `/in` mount. The adapter writes the engine's ALTO, or a neutral `boxes.json` with word, line or block boxes in declared units, into `/out/<run_id>/`.
   - The page request carries no page id, URL or batch, only what the engine needs to read the image.
   - The Rust types in a new crate, `usnm-ocr-contract`, are the source of truth. JSON Schemas generated from them serve the Python adapters, and a conformance suite runs against every image. The spec is [13 §13.4](../13-ocr-engines.md#134-the-contract-usnm-ocr-engine1).
2. **Every engine runs in its own image, pinned by digest, as a long-lived instance.**
   - An instance stays up between pages and reads them one at a time until the worker recycles it. Engines that can keep their models in memory do. CLI and script engines (the Tesseract and Kraken CLIs) load their models for each page, and that time is part of the page's measured time; their adapters still save a container start per page.
   - Tesseract runs in a container too. EL9 has no usable Tesseract (ADR-0015), and the survey must run the same artifact as production. Its adapter could later link libtesseract's C API to load models once per profile, if the survey shows the load time matters next to a full page's read.
   - CI builds the images from digest-pinned bases and sha256-pinned models and pushes them to the environment's private registry (`infra/modules/registry.bicep`: Basic, Entra only, CI pushes as `id-usnm-ci-<env>` over OIDC). `ocr/engines/engines.lock.json`, written by CI and reviewed in a PR, pins each image digest and its model hashes. Production never runs an image the lock doesn't pin.
   - The node group gets AcrPull on the registry. The worker pulls by digest with an Entra token from the Arc agent, exchanged for a registry token.
3. **Engines run under a separate account.**
   - A second system user, `usnmeng`, runs rootless podman with its own subordinate ids. It isn't in `himds`, so nothing it runs can read the Arc agent's token challenge.
   - Its user manager runs the Podman API service, with the socket at `/run/usnm-ocr/podman.sock`, shared with the worker through a group. The worker starts and stops engine containers with `podman --remote` over that socket, so it never needs user namespaces itself. Its unit keeps its hardening and adds `NoNewPrivileges=yes`, `RestrictNamespaces=yes` and an empty capability set.
   - Containers run with no network, a read-only root and all capabilities dropped. The container user maps to a subordinate id, not to `usnmeng`. Memory equals memory plus swap, with CPU and pid limits, and scratch space on a size-capped tmpfs, so an engine's files count against its own memory limit and can't fill the node's disk.
   - A spike on node 1 confirms that this works with SELinux enforcing before anything else is built. If it doesn't, this decision is amended.
4. **Rust does everything that decides or records something.**
   - The worker does the routing, the instance pool, deadlines and kills, and resource metering from each container's cgroup.
   - It decodes the scan, scales it and cuts it into tiles where a profile asks (docTR and Surya on full pages). It parses engine ALTO, writes the one stored ALTO, converts boxes to ALTO and merges tiles, extracts text in reading order, strips markup, runs `normalize_ocr`, scores damage with `usnm_core::damage` (12 Step 5) and records provenance.
   - An adapter only runs its engine on one image. It never tiles or merges tiles.
   - Adapters for CLI and HTTP engines, and for engines that can only be run as a script per page, are small Rust binaries: Tesseract, the Kraken CLI, vision-language models behind llama-server or vLLM, and a later oar-ocr. Adapters for engines that are Python libraries are thin Python on one shared helper, and import the engine once: docTR, Surya 2, NDNP Open OCR, American Stories (its pipeline's functions, not its script) and NDLOCR-Lite (its modules, not its `ocr.py`).
5. **One stored ALTO profile.**
   - The worker writes ALTO 3.1 (namespace `ns-v3`, `alto-3-1.xsd`) from parsed values, in pixels of the IIIF full image it fetched. Engine XML is never stored.
   - The page text is derived from that ALTO in reading order, then normalized. Block- and page-level engines put their text in the blocks of `boxes.json`, so the stored text and the ALTO always hold the same words.
6. **Routing is versioned data.**
   - `ocr/engines/engines.toml` lists the engines, their profiles, limits and licence gate.
   - `ocr/routing/routes.toml` holds ordered rules. A rule matches language, script, title, batch, date range, queue reason and damage score, and names an engine and profile, with fallbacks.
   - A profile carries default options (Tesseract: `psm = 3`), and a route's options override them. The dpi comes with the image (300 for a full scan), so every route, the catch-all included, reads at the dpi that main passes today.
   - A re-route is a reviewed change to these files with a version bump, and needs no new worker binary. The first release installs the files on the node with the worker. Later, CI publishes them to the registry as one artifact, and the worker polls for it.
   - Messages carry ISO 639-3 and base batch names (no `_verNN`). Validation (12 Step 7) rejects MARC-only codes such as `ger` and `cze`, which then dead-letter at once. `usnm_core::lang` (12 Step 4) maps MARC codes and LoC's pass-through names to ISO 639-3 for the seeder and the survey.
   - A node with no usable engine (image missing, breaker open, cgroup check failed) stops taking messages and backs off, so an engine outage on a one-node fleet doesn't use up the queue's receives.
   - When only some engines are down, the worker peeks, and receives past messages for those engines with a bounded defer. Each such message is received at most twice with the usual 1,800 s hide and left, then moved to `ocr-deadletter` with cause `unroutable`. The seeder queues it again after a growing wait, outside the page's limit of 3 attempts. Nodes can't change a message's visibility or put it back on a work queue, so this costs each blocked message up to 3 of its receives, and other engines' pages keep moving. Engines a node can never run get a queue per capability ([13 §13.7.6](../13-ocr-engines.md#1376-choosing-a-candidate)).
   - Each route has at least one candidate. `fallback_after` (receives per candidate before the next) defaults to 2 and is at least 1.
7. **Provenance on every page.**
   - `ocr_source` is `usnm-<engine family>`.
   - `ocr_engine` becomes a tag that code can parse: engine version, profile, image digest, model digest, route, routing version and contract version. Its short key, `<family>/<version> <profile>`, is what the release's engine index and the API use.
   - The ALTO's `OCRProcessing` holds the full digests.
   - A new `runs/` Parquet record, with one row per engine read in a receive that writes a page, holds the full `ocr_engine` tag, digests, options, route, resources, and damage before and after OCR. `ocr-sync` picks it up with the page's part and checks that its `ocr_engine` matches the part's. Reads in receives that write nothing (timeouts, crashes) go to telemetry with the same outcome and resource fields.
   - The overlay schema keeps its 16 columns.
8. **Licences gate production in data, in three tiers.** Each model in `engines.toml`, and each engine's code, falls into one of them, or is marked undecided ([13 §13.7.2](../13-ocr-engines.md#1372-enginestoml)). The worker and `routes check` refuse a production route to an engine marked `production = false`, to an engine whose code is outside the first two tiers or marked undecided, or to a profile that uses a model outside them or marked undecided. Moving an engine or a model between tiers is the maintainer's decision.
   - **Cleared.** The model's `license` is in `production_licenses`, which the maintainer edits. To start: Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-3-Clause, CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, and, by the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-10 because usnewsmap.com is entirely non-commercial, CC-BY-NC-4.0, CC-BY-SA-4.0 and Datalab's modified Open RAIL-M (`LicenseRef-Datalab-OpenRAIL-M`: Surya 2, Marker and Chandra). The re-check of 2026-10-11 added MinerU's licence (`LicenseRef-MinerU`), the DINOv3 License (`LicenseRef-DINOv3`) and dots.ocr's MIT licence with its supplemental agreement (`LicenseRef-dots-MIT`). `credit_required` marks the licences whose own terms require credit.
   - **Openly published, no explicit licence, attributed.** By the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-11, the release may use a model its author published openly for download without any licence or terms. Its entry sets `license = "none"` and records `source` (the URL it was fetched from), `author` (the author or publisher as the source names them), `fetched` (the date), a `note` saying it has no explicit licence and where that was checked, and a `credit` line. All of these are required, so the credits page can name it.
   - **Excluded.** A model whose published terms explicitly restrict our use (research or evaluation only, terms a non-commercial site can't meet, no redistribution, territory limits) carries `restricted`, which quotes the clause and links it. It can be surveyed but never routed in production, whatever its `license` says. `license = "unknown"` (terms not yet checked) is refused in the same way until someone checks them.
   - **Undecided.** A model whose terms are open to more than one reading carries `undecided`, saying what the maintainer has to decide. It is refused like an excluded model, whatever its `license` says (`none` included), until the maintainer decides.
   - Every model the release uses, in either of the first two tiers, needs `author`, `source` and `credit`, and is named on the site's credits page. No production route to a model whose licence requires credit, or to an attributed model, merges before that page exists.
9. **The survey runs the production path.**
   - A Rust binary, `usnm-ocr-survey`, uses the worker's engine host, the same lock and images, and the same profiles, ALTO writer, normalization and damage code.
   - A survey result is keyed by the image digest, model digest, profile and options that a production route would resolve to.
   - Round 1 from the Python harness stays as indicative only. Its Tesseract arm is re-run through the new runner before any routing decision.
10. **One engine per page by default.** A route may add a cascade once a replay of survey results shows the gain is worth the node time. A cascade reads a page with a second engine only when the first leaves its damage above a threshold, and it has guards against a fluent reading that isn't on the page. There is no best-of on every page and no word-level voting across engines.

## Alternatives

We compared three full designs. This decision is the one with a container per engine and JSON lines on stdin and stdout, with parts of the other two added.

It has two protocol layers (HTTP outside, JSON lines between the shim and a Python engine) and a shim process in every image, with quadlet and socket units rendered per engine.

## Consequences

- **New code.** Rust crates `usnm-ocr-contract`, `usnm-alto`, `usnm-ocr-route` and `usnm-ocr-adapter` (the CLI and HTTP adapters), and a Python package, `usnm_ocr_adapter`. The damage port (`usnm_core::damage`, cargo feature `damage`), the language map (`usnm_core::lang`), the pickup (`usnm-ingest ocr-sync`) and the release's reader are 12's (Steps 4 to 9). `ocr-sync`'s ALTO checks use `usnm-alto`, and its pickup also takes the runs records. The engine Containerfiles and `models.lock` move into the repository under `ocr/engines/`. The build order is in [13 §13.11](../13-ocr-engines.md#1311-build-order).
- **Node setup changes.** `node-setup.sh` adds `usnmeng` with lingering and its own subordinate ids, cgroup delegation to user managers, the Podman API socket, the tmpfs scratch and a tighter worker unit (`scripts/ocr-node/usnm-ocr-worker.service`, which 12 Step 2 creates). On GPU nodes it turns on the `container_use_devices` SELinux boolean. `offboard.sh` removes them.
- **The registry holds engine images.** The Basic tier includes 10 GiB of storage, and more is billed per GB. Nodes delete images no routing bundle names, and digests that wrote production rows are locked against deletion and overwrite. AcrPull is granted on the whole registry, so nodes could also pull the API and ingest images (code, not data). Repository-scoped permissions would switch the registry to a mode in which AcrPull and AcrPush no longer apply, and every existing grant would have to move.
- **The registry token exchange is new.** It turns an Entra token from the Arc agent into a registry token, and it hasn't been tested with an Arc identity. `podman --remote pull` hands that token to `usnmeng`'s Podman API service, so a compromise of `usnmeng` yields a short-lived AcrPull token for the whole registry.
- **Survey numbers from round 1 are indicative only.** Every survey image's digest changes when its entrypoint becomes an adapter. The round-1 images exist only in node 1's local storage under mutable tags, so they are saved by image id before anything is rebuilt.
- **`curated/ocr-local/` needs its own reader before any release** (12 Step 9). It must not reuse `ocr_ja::load` or `ocr_ja::indexable`, which read `loc_text` as LoC's failure class.
- **A credits page becomes a prerequisite.** No production route to a model in `credit_required` or in the attributed tier merges before the site has a credits page naming each engine and model used in production, with its author or publisher, source, and licence or "no explicit licence". MinerU's licence ends automatically if the site doesn't say it uses MinerU, and NDLOCR-Lite (CC BY 4.0, plus the DINOv3 License on its layout model) is already in production for the Japanese pages, so the page is owed now. Datalab's terms also put attribution and share-alike conditions on the Output, and the licensor can restrict use remotely; the maintainer accepted these on 2026-10-10.
- **The re-check of 2026-10-11** ([13 §13.7.2](../13-ocr-engines.md#1372-enginestoml), with every clause quoted and linked):
  - cleared: `frak2021`, which UB Mannheim deposited on Zenodo under CC0 1.0 (the same file the survey ran); Kraken's `austriannewspapers` (CC-BY-SA-4.0) and `german_print` (CC0) from Zenodo; NDNP Open OCR's code (public domain and CC0); docTR's code and its multilingual PARSeq checkpoint; EfficientOCR's code; GOT-OCR 2.0; Granite-Docling; Nougat's weights (CC BY-NC 4.0); MinerU with its MinerU2.5-Pro weights; NDLOCR-Lite with the DINOv3 License; and, by the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-11, dots.ocr and dots.mocr, whose supplemental agreement bars "unauthorized digitization of publications" but says the MIT License prevails on any conflict (1.6), and which we use on scans the Library of Congress made of mostly public-domain newspapers;
  - openly published with no explicit licence, attributed: UB Mannheim's Tesseract `german_print`, `nzz` and `austriannewspapers`, its Kraken `reichsanzeiger`, `digitue` and `ubma_segmentation`, and docTR's default weights; and, by the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-11, American Stories' code and weights, NDNP Open OCR's segmentation model and EfficientOCR's `effocr_en`. Their layout model carries an Ultralytics `AGPL-3.0` stamp in its ONNX metadata, added by the export tool. We run it on our own nodes, don't distribute it and don't offer a modified version over a network, so AGPL-3.0's obligations wouldn't apply even if it covers the weights, and the text we publish isn't an AGPL-3.0 work;
  - excluded: Qwen2.5-VL-3B, CHURRO 3B and Nanonets-OCR2-3B (Qwen Research License, "for research or evaluation purposes only"), HunyuanOCR (no use or display of its Output outside a territory that leaves out the EU, the UK and South Korea), and, by the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-11, EasyOCR's weights (Jaided AI's terms limit its free "Services" to "personal, non-commercial use"; EasyOCR's code stays cleared).
- **Block-level engines give coarse geometry.** Their lines and words inherit the block's box, so any later use of their ALTO geometry, such as highlighting, is coarse. The recorded granularity says so, and the survey compares their text by alignment instead of word positions.
- **What an escape reaches.** An engine that escapes its container lands on a subordinate id of `usnmeng`, or on `usnmeng` itself if the escape goes through the runtime (crun or conmon). Neither can reach the Arc token files or the exchange account. `usnmeng` owns the Podman API socket and the engine images, and holds the registry token during a pull. Podman doesn't re-verify image layers when it runs a container. The digest check catches a wrong image, but not tampering inside `usnmeng`'s storage.
- **Engine outages cost receives.** While some engines are down, pages for them use up to 3 of their 5 receives and then wait for the seeder to queue them again. Limits set on cgroups above an engine's own scope are checked too, so a systemd slice can't leave an engine less memory than the scheduler assumes.
- **Contract changes are expensive.** A breaking change means rebuilding every image, so the worker supports versions N and N-1 while it happens.
- **Two ALTO unit systems.** The stored ALTO is in pixels, while LoC's and the Japanese job's are in inch1200. Readers must check `MeasurementUnit`.

## Runtime spike evidence (2026-10-18)

[Issue #307's item-0 receipt](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/307#issuecomment-6250783922)
records a passing SELinux-enforcing run on a new, isolated RHEL 10.2 VM
on pve-big (VM 104), not either production OCR node. It used kernel
6.12.0-211.66.1, Podman 5.8.2, crun 1.27, container-selinux 2.248.0 and
systemd 257. The worker unit's hardening remained intact. The checks cover
the rootless API socket, delegated controllers, subordinate IDs, JSON-line
attach streams with logging disabled, MCS/ACL isolation, effective limits,
OOM state before removal, and memory charging for both scratch and
container-local tmpfs writes. No SELinux policy changes were needed; the
boot audit search found no `nnp_transition` denial. VM 104 was shut down
and retained with automatic startup disabled.

Podman's reported `State.CgroupPath` names the libpod scope on this stack,
not the process's `/container` child. The child's no-swap limit is tighter
than its parent's. The spike therefore reads `/proc/<State.Pid>/cgroup`
and walks from that leaf through the scope when checking effective limits;
the existing container memory/swap flags do not need changing.

This accepts the runtime transport/isolation spike only. Its synthetic
`{"type":"hello","contract":1}` round trip is not a real adapter hello or
production `contract=1` OCR result. Real-image conformance, lock/registry,
engine-host completion and production deployment remain separate gates.

## Optional BOINC batch transport (#438)

The [BOINC pilot](../../../boinc/docs/README.md) is a separate, file-based single-page transport for trusted volunteers. It reuses the current Tesseract models and routing and the native ingestion checks, retains `contract=0`, and records its route as `boinc@r1`. It does not implement or replace the long-lived adapter protocol above. Migration to that protocol remains a later change. Only the central bridge reserves native work and publishes results; volunteers hold no Azure identity.

### OCR credits page (#372)

`/credits` reads the serving version's per-engine page counts from
`/v1/status` (`published.sources.ocr_local.by_engine` and
`published.sources.ocr_ja.by_engine`). `ocr_ja.by_engine` is the union of
Japanese search-index pages and main-index Latin-script replacements,
deduplicated per page and engine. Hidden main-index copies are excluded; a
reading still served independently by the Japanese index keeps its credit.
The counts are frozen in the release, not taken from the latest OCR job;
older releases fall back to `ja_latin.by_engine` when available. Each “Our
OCR” badge links to the exact engine key's fragment; the footer and “Pages
we read ourselves” also link to the page.

Vite parses `ocr/engines/engines.toml` at build time for both the page and
its tests. Only serving engines and their selected profile models appear;
the pre-catalog Japanese NDLOCR-Lite pipeline uses its catalog credit and
bundled DINOv3 model. Survey inventory alone is not evidence of use.
Unknown serving keys or incomplete credits produce an explicit error, and
the end-to-end inventory coverage test fails instead of leaving them out.
Licence links, mandatory attribution and attributed-tier evidence come
from the catalog. Model revisions absent from the existing serving
inventory are labelled as unrecorded. Current worker image pins are
checked against the catalog, but they are not evidence of the model
revision that produced a retained short-key reading; those revisions stay
unrecorded until per-reading digests can verify them.

New releases freeze the used catalog entries and mandatory-attribution list
in `credits.json`, checked by the reference manifest and exposed as
`published.sources.ocr_credits`. Publication fails if a serving engine key
cannot be credited. The page prefers that frozen snapshot; only releases
predating this file use the catalog bundled at web build time. This keeps
credits for a serving version independent of later catalog edits.
