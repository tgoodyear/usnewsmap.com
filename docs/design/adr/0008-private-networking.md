# ADR-0008: Private networking for app → data paths

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09
- **Amends:** ADR-0006, which had deferred all network isolation to the growth profile
- **Amended by:** [ADR-0027](0027-onprem-serving-behind-cloudflare.md) (behind `onPremServing`, the lake's opening to the home IP is permanent while serving is on-prem, and Cosmos allows the home IP with its policy exemption)

## Context

Every path from an app or job to storage or Cosmos already used managed identities, with keys disabled. But the data services' public endpoints were open (Entra-only) because the ACI Spot backfill workers can't join a VNet and have no stable outbound IP. The maintainer asked for private networking on those paths and chose "private in steady state".

## Decision

- **VNet-integrated Container Apps environment** (current prod VNet `vnet-usnm-prod`, environment `cae-usnm-prod`, `/27` delegated subnet; workload-profiles env with the Consumption profile). The public API keeps external ingress at `api.usnewsmap.com`.
- **Private endpoints** `pe-usnm-blob` for `stusnmdffapzy` (Blob) and `pe-usnm-cosmos` for `cosmos-usnm-prod-ffapzy` (Sql), with linked private DNS zones. These are the pinned prod names; dev and experiments use the conventional names in [ADR-0017](0017-resource-naming.md) and scripts read stack outputs. **`publicNetworkAccess: Disabled`** on both in steady state.
- **Managed identity on every path** (see the table in [08 §8.3](../08-azure-infrastructure.md#83-networking)). Keys stay disabled, and Azure Policy **denies** re-enabling them.
- **Guarded public-access window** only while a Spot backfill or full re-index runs:
  - the launcher records a window item in Cosmos with an expiry, then enables public access (still Entra-only, no IP rules);
  - it disables public access again when the work completes;
  - an hourly in-VNet `network-guard` job closes any window that is expired or wasn't recorded;
  - every change to `publicNetworkAccess` raises an alert.
- **Drop the Storage Queue.** Cosmos leases already claim work, so the queue was only a wake-up signal, and removing it avoids a third private endpoint (~$8/month).

## Alternatives

| Option                                                          | Why not                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Identity-only (previous lean design)                            | Cheapest (−$17/mo), but data services reachable from the internet (with a valid token) at all times                                                    |
| Always private, backfill on VNet-integrated Container Apps Jobs | No public window ever, but the backfill costs ~$150–250 instead of ~$25–50, and full re-indexes cost more each time. Kept as the growth-profile option |
| IP allow-lists                                                  | ACI Spot egress IPs are unknowable, and a Consumption environment's outbound IPs can change; brittle                                                   |
| Azure Monitor Private Link Scope for telemetry                  | Adds cost and complexity for low-sensitivity telemetry; growth profile                                                                                 |

## Consequences

- About **+$17/month** (2 endpoints, 2 DNS zones, per-GB processing). The typical month is ~$72, and a press-spike month ~$114 (see [09 §9.5](../09-operations-security-cost.md#95-cost-model-monthly-usd-list-prices-confirm-with-the-azure-pricing-calculator)).
- The **2 vCPU search lever no longer fits under $80** without dropping private endpoints or raising the ceiling. This is flagged as a maintainer decision in [10 §10.4](../10-roadmap-and-risks.md#104-open-questions-for-the-maintainer).
- The Azure portal's Data Explorer and Storage Browser can't reach the data from the internet in steady state. Maintainers use the in-VNet `usnm-ingest admin` job, or open a short recorded window.
- The environment must be created with VNet integration from the start.

## Amendment, October 2026: the on-prem Serial Set runner (#229)

The Serial Set fetch (`usnm-ingest congress-serialset`) runs on an OCR node at home instead of as the Azure job `usnm-sset-caj-<env>`, so it costs no Azure compute. The subscription is over its budget, and the fetch spends most of its time waiting on GovInfo, at one request a second. Its output still goes to the data lake, which the node can't reach through the private endpoint. With `USNM_SERIALSET_ONPREM` on:

- **The data lake allows public network access from the node IPs only.** `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled`, `defaultAction: Deny`, `bypass: None`, and one IP rule per address in `USNM_OCR_NODE_IPS` (the operator's home IP, a private setting, never committed). Nothing needs a trusted-service bypass: every Azure caller uses the private endpoint, which stays. Keys stay off, so a request from that IP still needs an Entra token with a data role. With no node IPs, the account stays closed.
- **One grant, scoped by path.** The runner's identity (`USNM_SERIALSET_RUNNER`, the node's Arc machine identity, a private setting) gets a custom role, `usnm-sset-writer-role-<env>`, on the `curated` container with an ABAC condition. The role has blob read, write and create data actions and no control-plane actions, so it can't delete or reconfigure the container either. The condition allows list, read and create only under `congress/serialset/`, and no delete or move anywhere (`infra/modules/serialset-runner.bicep`). The fetch lists only its own series, so it needs nothing else.
- **No Cosmos access.** The fetch's lock (`congress-serialset`) is held in a local state file (`--state-file`) on the node, so Cosmos stays private and the node gets no Cosmos role. That lock doesn't see the Azure job's, so the Azure job must not run while the node does. If both run, attempts are create-only, so the second writer of a volume's attempt fails instead of overwriting it.
- **The policy exempts the lake by resource id** while it is open (`publicAccountIds`, `infra/public-accounts.bicep`), the same way it exempts the exchange account and the nodes' Key Vault. Provision writes the assignment before the stack (#336, 08 §8.5).

Turning `USNM_SERIALSET_ONPREM` off closes the lake, removes the grant and drops the exemption at the next provision. Turn it off once the fetch is done. Monthly updates can run the same way, or as the Azure job.

Three other options were considered and not chosen: a VPN gateway into the VNet (a new paid resource); running the job in Azure (the compute this avoids); staging the output in the exchange account, which the node can already reach, and copying it into the lake from Azure (a copy job is Azure compute again, and the copy step is new code).

## Amendment, October 2026: Cosmos for the on-prem BOINC host (#967)

The BOINC server and its controller run on-prem (#942), and the hand-off's `claim` and `collect` steps move there too (#967 phase 3), which retires the Azure hand-off job. `claim pull` needs Cosmos: it takes the `ops` lock and reads the published version. `collect` needs no Cosmos: it writes the ledger in `curated` and pages in `ocr-out`, through the lake and the exchange account, which already allow the node IPs. So the maintainer chose to open Cosmos to the home IP rather than wait for its data to move on-prem with serving (#955). PR #1044 has two separate switches:

- `USNM_COSMOS_ONPREM_ACCESS` opens Cosmos's firewall only.
- `USNM_BOINC_HANDOFF_ONPREM` grants the roles, and needs `USNM_OCR_NODES` on and `USNM_BOINC_ONPREM_HOST` set.

With both on:

- **Cosmos allows public network access from the node IPs only.** `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled`, `networkAclBypass: None`, and one `ipRules` entry per address in `USNM_OCR_NODE_IPS`, with no `0.0.0.0` rule, which would admit every Azure network. With no node IPs, it stays closed. The private endpoint stays, and Azure callers keep using it: private endpoint traffic isn't filtered by the IP rules.
- **Entra only.** `disableLocalAuth: true` and `disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess` stay, so a request from that IP still needs an Entra token with a data-plane role.
- **One identity.** Only the BOINC host's own Arc machine identity (`USNM_BOINC_ONPREM_HOST`, a private setting) gets roles, the hand-off job's existing ones: Cosmos Built-in Data Contributor on `ops` alone, the ledger writer on `curated` (`ocr-local/` only), reader on `reference`, the node writer role on `ocr-out`, and Message Processor and Sender on the two work queues. It isn't granted to the whole on-prem group.
- **The policy exempts Cosmos by resource id** while it's open (`publicAccountIds`), as it does the lake for the Serial Set runner.

Turning `USNM_COSMOS_ONPREM_ACCESS` off closes Cosmos again at the next provision. When Cosmos's data moves on-prem with serving (#955), this goes away.

## Amendment, November 2026: no private endpoints on the cold spare (#308, #955)

Production serves on-prem ([ADR-0029](0029-onprem-primary-azure-failover.md)), and the Azure API and searcher sit at zero replicas as its spare. The three endpoints cost $0.72 a day, about as much as storing the Azure index Hot, to protect a path that carries no traffic until a failover. With `USNM_DATA_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=false`:

- **No endpoints or private DNS** for the data lake, the index account or Cosmos.
- **Service endpoints on snet-cae**, `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.AzureCosmosDB`, and a firewall rule for that subnet on each account. The lake also keeps its rule for the BOINC subnet while the hand-off job exists. `defaultAction: Deny`, `bypass: None` and Cosmos's `networkAclBypass: None` stay.
- **Public network access is on for all three**, behind those firewalls, so the public-network policy lists them by resource id. Provision already writes the list before the stack. The IP rules still follow the on-prem settings alone.
- **Identity doesn't change.** Shared keys, local auth and anonymous access stay off, there's no SAS, and the roles are the same. A request from an allowed subnet still needs an Entra token with a data-plane role.

The traffic stays on the Azure backbone. The change gives up one layer of defence. The accounts' public addresses now answer and refuse requests, where before they were closed. dev keeps its endpoints by default. The Azure portal still can't reach the data from outside the allowed addresses.

The index account stays Hot. Moving the spare's index to Cool would save about $0.30 a day, but October's releases came 2 to 12 days apart. Each release costs $0.70 more in writes, and deleting a version early bills the rest of its 30 days in Cool, about $0.36 a day. Cool breaks even at about 18 days between releases, and loses about $0.30 a day at 12 days and about $5 a day at 2. So the maintainer kept Hot ([runbook](../../operations/search-serving.md#the-azure-cold-spare)). `USNM_INDEX_ACCESS_TIER` stays in the settings.
