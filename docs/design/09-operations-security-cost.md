# 09: Operations, Security & Cost

## 9.1 Service level objectives

| SLI | SLO (30-day) | Measured by |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Availability of `/v1/aggregate` and `/v1/hits`: good = non-5xx; **every 5xx (including 503 backend timeout) counts as bad**; 4xx (400 syntax, 422 query-too-broad, 429) are client outcomes, not failures | **99.0%** (lean) / 99.5% (growth) | API logs + availability tests |
| Latency of `/v1/aggregate`, uncached, typical query set | p95 ≤ **2 s** (high-frequency set ≤ 15 s on lean) | API server spans |
| Latency of `/v1/aggregate`, cached (moka or Blob) | p95 ≤ **150 ms** | API server spans |
| Data freshness (LoC batch published → searchable) | ≤ **7 days** for 95% of batches | Manifests vs discover log |
| SPA LCP | p75 ≤ **2.5 s** | App Insights browser telemetry |

The error budget for 99.0% is about 7.3 hours per month. When it is exhausted, feature deploys pause in favor of reliability work.

## 9.2 Observability

- **Traces:** OpenTelemetry from the SPA (App Insights JS) → API → search backend. The trace id is propagated with `traceparent`. Spans: `parse`, `cache`, `backend.aggregate`, `postprocess`, `encode`.
- **Metrics:** request rate, error rate and latency per endpoint; cache hit ratio (moka and Blob); backend latency; searcher CPU/memory/split-cache hits; ingest pages/s; batches queued/claimed/failed (Cosmos); public-access window state; index doc count by version.
- **Logs:** structured JSON (`tracing` → OTLP). **No query text is logged at info level**. Query text goes only into the search log (below), which is a blob container, not a log.
- **API (as built):** one Application Insights request per request except the health probes, named by method and route template, and one console line with method, route, status and milliseconds; metrics for requests, latency, search backend time, cache hits and misses (in-process and Blob), rejected queries, reference reloads and the serving index version (08 §8.1.2). `scripts/logs.sh <env> api-requests` and `api-errors` summarize them. The site's page views reach `AppPageViews` through the API (`POST /v1/beacon`, 06 §6.3.7), and `scripts/logs.sh <env> traffic` and the API workbook's Traffic section summarize them. Other browser telemetry and `traceparent` propagation from the SPA are not built.
- **Ingest jobs:** JSON console logs in Log Analytics, traces and metrics in Application Insights (08 §8.1.2). To look at a run: `scripts/logs.sh <env> release-progress`, `curation-throughput`, `curate-replicas`, `errors-by-batch` or `job-executions` (queries in `ops/queries/`), then the `release` and `curate` traces in Application Insights.
- **Dashboards:** an Azure Workbook "USNM Overview" with golden signals, cost to date, ingest status, and the top canonical queries (k ≥ 5, from the search log). Built so far: the workbooks "usnewsmap pipeline" and "usnewsmap API" (08 §8.1.2), with no query text; cost to date and top queries are not in them.
- **Alerts (Action Group → email + optional Teams/Slack webhook):** SLO burn rate (fast 2%/1 h, slow 5%/6 h); built: API 5xx (at least 5 in 10 minutes and over 2% of requests; searches that ran past their 2-minute limit or were refused as busy (the queue for a computation slot full or waited out) are counted apart, and raise it only at 10 in 10 minutes, which looks like a searcher that has stopped answering), `/v1/aggregate` p95 over 3 s for 15 minutes, at least 3 searches in an hour longer than a visitor waits or refused as busy (severity 3, from `api.slow_searches`; the API workbook charts them), and the site's home page or `/readyz` failing from 2 of 3 locations (standard availability tests, 08 §8.1.2); an ingest or backfill job failed (any failure but the expected titles-sync stop, within 15 minutes, naming the execution and the reason); the ingest job not progressing (severity 3: titles-sync stops not followed by another execution within 3 hours, or 3 in a row without fewer titles left); a release stalled (no progress line for 10 minutes); a backfill stalled (no batch curated in an hour while workers run); a backfill replica silent for 15 minutes while it runs; oldest `queued` batch > 48 h; budget at 80% forecast; App Insights daily cap reached.

## 9.3 Runbooks (kept in `ops/runbooks/`)

| Runbook | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **Full re-index** | Run `index --full --target pages-v{date}` → verify doc count equals curated rows and golden-query counts match → flip `current.json` → pre-warm → delete the old index after 7 days |
| **Rollback index** | Point `current.json` back to the previous `index_version` (kept 7 days) |
| **Rollback app** | Container Apps: shift traffic to the previous revision |
| **Search engine down** | The API serves cached results. An uncached request returns 503 with a friendly message and the SPA shows a banner. Restart the revision; if the index is corrupt, roll back the index version |
| **Public access left open** | Azure Policy denies public network access on the data accounts, so this needs a policy exemption (a Spot backfill window). Removing the exemption does not close an account that is already open: set `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled` on it, then delete the exemption, and check the Activity Log for who opened it |
| **Cost spike** | Check the request mix in App Insights (bot?); tighten the API token bucket; confirm `maxReplicas: 2`; confirm the Log Analytics daily cap; check for a backfill job left running (`az containerapp job execution list`) |
| **LoC source change** | If the discover job fails its schema check, pause ingestion (the site keeps serving), then update the parser |

## 9.4 Security

### 9.4.1 Threat model (STRIDE summary)

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Denial of service / cost exhaustion** | Uncached, expensive queries in bulk (the realistic top risk for a public search site) | In-process + Blob caches; canonicalization; API token bucket (per client); query complexity limits; backend concurrency semaphore; 2 computation slots for searches, which also bound how many keep running after a `202`, a queue of at most 16 for them, and a 2-minute limit on each (06 §6.6); budget alerts; max replica caps |
| **Injection** | Query-language injection into the engine (the legacy Solr risk) | AST-only translation; no raw syntax pass-through; fuzzing |
| **XSS** | Snippets containing OCR'd markup; title metadata | Server-side escaping; only `<mark>` allowed; strict **CSP** that the API sets on every response (`SECURITY_HEADERS` in `crates/usnm-api/src/site.rs`): `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (MapLibre sets inline styles); `connect-src 'self' https://*.blob.core.windows.net https://tiles.openfreemap.org` (the API on the same origin, PMTiles range requests, the basemap); `img-src 'self' data: blob: https:` (page images linked from LoC); `font-src 'self' https://tiles.openfreemap.org`; `worker-src 'self' blob:` (MapLibre workers); `object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'`. There is no `frame-ancestors`, so the site can still be embedded, as the legacy site was. The site's page views go to its own origin (`/v1/beacon`), so `connect-src 'self'` covers them. Playwright tests assert that there are no CSP violations. React escapes by default |
| **Supply chain** | Crates, npm packages, container images | `cargo-deny`, `cargo-audit`, Dependabot, CodeQL, pinned image digests, SBOM, signed images (Notation or cosign) |
| **Secret leakage** | Keys in the repo (happened in the legacy repo) | Managed identities; account keys and Cosmos keys **disabled and policy-locked**; GitHub secret scanning + **push protection**; no keys exist at runtime |
| **Data-plane exposure** | Direct internet access to storage or Cosmos | Private endpoints with `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled`, and Azure Policy denies enabling it on the data accounts; Entra-only auth everywhere |
| **Tampering with data** | Poisoned bulk files or mirrors | Checksum verification against LoC manifests; mirrors used only after verification; source checksums recorded in the manifests; blob versioning on `curated/` |
| **Elevation** | CI credentials | OIDC federated credentials scoped to the environment and branch; no long-lived secrets; least-privilege RBAC |

### 9.4.2 Privacy

- The application collects **no accounts, cookies or PII**. The site is anonymous by design. The one bounded exception is platform access logs, described next.
- **IP addresses:** the API never writes client IPs to its logs or telemetry, and App Insights IP collection stays masked (the default). The one place the API passes a client address on is a page view's `ai.location.ip` tag (06 §6.3.7): ingestion derives the city, region and country from it and stores `0.0.0.0`. Container Apps doesn't emit per-request access logs by default, and the lean profile leaves them off. **Exception:** if HTTP access logs are turned on to investigate abuse (or Front Door logs in the growth profile), they contain raw client IPs, go only to Log Analytics, and are **retained for at most 30 days**. Those logs would also record the request URI, and every search puts its text in `q`. So a Log Analytics **ingestion-time transformation** (data collection rule) is attached before such logs are enabled; it **drops the query string** from the URI fields (`requestUri`, `RequestUri_s` and equivalents), so only the path is stored. A deployment check refuses to enable access-log diagnostic settings without that transformation. The API rate-limiter keys are **salted hashes** held only in memory.
- **Query text** is treated as potentially sensitive (genealogy searches contain family names). It is never logged per request. The API's request logs and traces record the **route template only** (`/v1/aggregate`, never the path or query string), and a test checks that search text in a query string reaches neither the exported telemetry nor the console log. At info, the Quickwit sidecar logs every search's query; `infra/modules/containerapp.bicep` sets its search targets to `warn` (08 §8.1.2), which takes effect when the stack is deployed. The lines logged before that carry no client address and leave `ContainerAppConsoleLogs` after its 30-day retention. The response cache (in memory for up to a day, and slow responses in the `cache/` container, deleted 14 days after they are written) holds responses that echo the canonical query, with nothing about who asked. Page views can't carry search text: `/v1/beacon` accepts a page name, never a path or query (06 §6.3.7). Access logs, if enabled, are scrubbed as described above.
- **Search log** ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-anonymous-search-log.md), 06 §6.8). The one place search text is kept on purpose, indefinitely, in the `searches` container of the private data account. Each search is one record with the words, the filters, the page count, the index version and the UTC day, and nothing about who searched: no address, user agent, referrer, identifier, location or time of day. The day, not the hour, because `AppPageViews` has each view's exact time and approximate location for 90 days, and on a small site an hour and a city can single out one visitor. Day files are shuffled so their order doesn't give the time back. Searches with Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control, from bots, from other sites and from the cache warm-up are not recorded. Only operators listed in `USNM_SEARCH_LOG_READERS` can read it (Storage Blob Data Reader on the container). Nothing public shows raw queries; anything ever published from it must be k-anonymized with k ≥ 5 (only queries searched at least five times, with no rare combination of query and filters).
  - **Reading it:** `scripts/searches.sh <env> [days]` (default 30) lists the day files, downloads them to a temporary directory with the operator's Entra sign-in (`az storage blob download --auth-mode login`) and prints searches per day (by source, with those that found nothing), the top 50 queries and the top 50 that found nothing, then deletes the files. The data account takes connections only through its private endpoint (ADR-0008), so it runs from a network that reaches it.
- **The status page** (`/status`, data from `GET /v1/status`, [06 §6.3.6](06-api-design.md#636-get-v1status)) is public on purpose: batch names, LoC URLs and counts are public data. It shows no identities, hostnames, resource names, client ids, blob URLs or full worker ids, and pipeline error text is sanitized and shortened in the API before it is served. Its Cosmos access is the read-only Data Reader role on the three containers it shows (`batches`, `index_runs`, `ops`), and its cost is bounded: at most one refresh (three queries) per minute per API replica (two at most), whatever the traffic, cached for 30 s in browsers. Its pages by state and by language come from the reference snapshot already in memory, so they add no Cosmos or search queries. Pages by language need the snapshot's `title_pages.json`, which every release writes for the whole version; if the published version is older than that file, the table shows newspaper counts only until the next release.
- **Page views** (07 §7.8): one per page, with the page name and title, the referrer's origin and `utm_*` tags on the first page of a load, and the device type and browser family the API works out from the user agent. No cookie, storage or identifier, so page views can't be joined into visits or visitors. Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control turn them off in the browser, and the API drops any that arrive with either header.
- **Retention.** Application Insights data (`AppPageViews`, `AppRequests`, `AppTraces`, `AppMetrics`) is kept 90 days, the component's default, which the workspace's 30-day default doesn't shorten. Console logs (`ContainerAppConsoleLogs`) are kept 30 days. The workspace and the component are in East US 2.
- **The privacy page** (`/privacy`, `web/src/privacy/PrivacyPage.tsx`) states what is collected: page views and their fields, approximate location with the address not stored, the request records without search text, the search log (search words kept indefinitely with only the filters, page count and day, not recorded under DNT or GPC), the response cache, the rate limiter's in-memory hashes, the region and the retention, legitimate interest as the basis, why there is no consent banner (nothing is stored on the device), the basemap from OpenFreeMap and newspaper pages at the Library of Congress under their own policies, and the maintainer's contact page. Its statements are checked against the code and the deployment; change them together.
- This replaces the legacy practice of storing IPs, cookies and full headers for every search, indefinitely.

### 9.4.3 Content and licensing

- Chronicling America content is freely usable. Attribute LoC/NEH and the contributing awardee on result lists and in exports.
- OpenStreetMap data (basemap): the ODbL attribution is always visible.
- GNIS and TIGER are US public domain.
- Code license: **MIT** ([LICENSE](../../LICENSE)), a permissive license that allows reuse. The legacy repo's license needs confirming before any legacy code is copied, but the plan is a clean-room rewrite.

## 9.5 Cost model (monthly, USD, list prices; confirm with the Azure Pricing Calculator)

**Rate assumptions (East US 2, pay-as-you-go).**
- **Container Apps Consumption:** active use is $0.000024 per vCPU-second and $0.000003 per GiB-second. The idle rate applies when a replica is warm but not processing requests. Published sources give **$0.000003–0.000008 per vCPU-second and $0.000001–0.000003 per GiB-second** for idle; the table uses the low end for "Low" and the high end for "High". The free grant each month is 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds and 2M requests per subscription; it applies to active usage.
- **Blob Hot LRS:** about $0.02 per GB-month. **Cool LRS:** about $0.01 per GB-month.
- **Egress:** the first 100 GB per month is free.
- **Log Analytics:** the first 5 GB per month is free.

### Lean profile (default, [ADR-0006](adr/0006-lean-hosting-profile.md)): target under $80

| Item | Assumption | Low | Typical | High |
|------|------------|-----|---------|------|
| Container App `ca-usnm` (API + Quickwit sidecar) | 1 replica × 4 vCPU / 8 GiB (the Consumption maximum, since 9 October 2026, #251), always warm, mostly idle rate: about $95 a month idle (4 vCPU at $0.000003/s, 8 GiB at $0.000003/GiB-s), less the free grant. Active search time adds $0.000021 per vCPU-second over idle. A spike month scales to a second replica for some hours | $90 | $100 | $140 |
| Blob: search index (Hot) | 0.5–0.9 TB | $10 | $14 | $18 |
| Blob: curated Parquet (Cool) | 150–300 GB; read only during rebuilds | $2 | $2 | $3 |
| Blob: reference, response cache, tiles (Hot) + transactions | ~20–40 GB | $1 | $2 | $4 |
| Container Apps Jobs (weekly incremental ingest, stats, pre-warm) | Mostly within the free grant | $0 | $1 | $3 |
| Egress | The site, tiles and API responses via Azure egress (first 100 GB free) | $0 | $0 | $5 |
| Log Analytics / App Insights | Normal days stay within the free 5 GB/month; prod's 1 GB daily cap bounds bursts from bulk jobs (dev's 150 MB cap keeps it free at any rate). Each API request adds a request row (~1 KB) and a console line (~0.2 KB) | $0 | $0 | $3 |
| Availability tests | 1 standard test (the site home page) × 3 locations, every 15 minutes, $0.0005 per run | $4 | $4 | $4 |
| Cosmos DB (document state) | Free tier: 1,000 RU/s + 25 GB (serverless ~$1–3 if the free tier is taken) | $0 | $0 | $3 |
| **Private networking** ([ADR-0008](adr/0008-private-networking.md)) | 2 private endpoints (Blob, Cosmos) at ~$7.30/month each; 2 private DNS zones at ~$0.50; data processed through the endpoints at ~$0.01/GB (Quickwit split reads, cache, jobs: ~50–300 GB) | $16 | $17 | $19 |
| Azure DNS zone | 1 zone + queries | $1 | $1 | $1 |
| Container registry | ACR Basic (private images) | $5 | $5 | $5 |
| Ingest scratch share (08 §8.4) | NFS Azure Files, provisioned v2 SSD, 128 GiB at about $0.10/GiB, baseline IOPS and throughput included; its private endpoint ($7.30) and private DNS zone ($0.50); endpoint data processing for releases (a full rebuild moves about 1–2 TB through it, ~$10–20 that month) | $21 | $22 | $41 |
| **Total** | | **~$150** | **~$168** | **~$249** |

Every column **exceeds $80**, driven by compute: the 4 vCPU / 8 GiB replica is a stopgap for cold-search latency on the American Stories index (#251) until the index-side fixes there land, after which it can go back down. "High" is a press-spike month billed at the upper idle rates. The ingest scratch share (October 2026) puts even a typical month over the $80 target: it is what lets the writer merge an index into a few large splits, which cold searches need (05 §5.5.1). The lever is its size (`USNM_INGEST_SCRATCH_GIB`; a smaller share means a smaller `split_num_docs_target` and more splits), or `0` to remove it. The hard cap is `maxReplicas: 2`: even if both replicas ran at the **active** rate all month (a sustained attack, not realistic traffic), compute would be about $620 at 4 vCPU / 8 GiB each (8 vCPU at $0.000024/s plus 16 GiB at $0.000003/s over 30 days; about $200 at the earlier 2.25 / 4.5). Budget alerts at $40, $60 and $75 (actual) and $80 (forecast) trigger the cost-spike runbook well before that.

**Sidecar size is the biggest cost lever.** Quickwit went from 1 to 2 vCPU in October 2026 and to 3.75 vCPU / 7.5 GiB on 9 October 2026 (#251). Each vCPU with its 2 GiB costs about $24 a month at the idle rate. Going back to 2 vCPU / 4 GiB (replica 2.25 / 4.5) saves about $41 a month once the index needs less CPU per search; the other options are dropping the private endpoints (−$17, back to identity-only) or accepting slower common-word searches.

### One-time backfill (Container Apps Jobs)

| Stage | Assumption | Estimate |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Curation workers | 4 replicas × 1 vCPU / 2 GiB × ~60 h: downloads are paced to LoC's limit, so workers are billed while they wait (04 §4.4). Consumption list price | ~$20–30 |
| Full index build | `caj-usnm-ingest`, 4 vCPU / 8 GiB × ~12–24 h (not yet measured at full size; 04 §4.1.2), ~$0.43/h at Consumption list price | ~$5–10 |
| Storage transactions + curated writes | | ~$5 |
| **Total** | | **~$30–45** |

The curation estimate assumes downloads keep up with the workers. In the September 2026 trial (04 §4.1.2), archives not in LoC's CDN cache downloaded at 0.3–1.2 MB/s. If that holds from Azure, the workers mostly wait on the network: the backfill takes days longer, and workers that stay up while waiting cost more than the table shows.

The ACI Spot alternative (08 §8.4) comes to about the same, ~$25–50, but needs the launcher and the public-access window.

If Spot capacity is unavailable, running the same workload on regular-priority ACI costs about $80–150, and on Azure Batch Spot about $25–50. A full re-index later (no download) costs about $5 on Spot.

### Growth profile

This is the original design: Front Door Standard (edge cache and rate limiting), separate API and search apps with a 4 vCPU / 8 GiB searcher, ZRS storage, ACR and raw archive retention. It costs about **$180 (low), $345 (typical) and $695 (high)** per month. Each piece is a Bicep parameter switch, not a redesign.

### Managed-search alternative (Azure AI Search)

L1 × 1 partition costs about **$2,800 per month** (about $5,600 with 2 replicas for an SLA). The preview **Serverless Developer** tier caps an index at 1 GB, so it can't hold the corpus. AI Search is outside the lean budget; it stays documented as the managed alternative.

### Cost controls

- Budget alerts at $60/$70/$78 (actual and forecast)
- `maxReplicas: 2` on the only always-on app
- Log Analytics daily cap
- Curated data kept in Cool storage; raw archives not retained
- `dev` scales to zero
- Spot compute only for offline jobs
- A tag policy (`project=usnm`, `env=`) enables cost-by-environment views

## 9.6 Backup and disaster recovery

| Asset | Protection | RPO / RTO |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Raw LoC archives | Not retained (lean profile); LoC is the source of record; checksums in Cosmos batch state | Re-download (days) |
| Cosmos DB document state | Continuous backup (7-day point-in-time restore); rebuildable from Parquet + the LoC batch list | RPO minutes / RTO hours |
| `curated/`, `reference/` | Flat-namespace account with **blob versioning + soft delete (14 d)**. Curated data is written to immutable attempt paths and reference data to immutable per-version snapshots, so nothing committed is ever overwritten; versioning and soft delete cover accidental deletes and overwrites. LRS (ZRS in the growth profile); rebuildable by re-downloading from LoC on ACI Spot (~$25–50) | RPO 0 / RTO ≤ 24 h from versions, ~1 week from LoC |
| Search index | Disposable; rebuild from `curated/` | RTO ≤ 24 h full rebuild; the previous version is kept 7 days for instant rollback |
| Code, IaC, runbooks | GitHub | RPO 0 |
| Region outage | Not active/active (cost). Everything is PaaS, so there are no VM images or disks to replicate. Stand up a **new** environment in the paired region, `scripts/bootstrap.sh <new-env> --location <paired region>` (`--location` applies to new environments only; an existing one keeps its region), **restore from GRS** if GRS is enabled (+~$20/mo for GRS on curated/reference), and point the domain at it. Remove the old one with `scripts/teardown.sh <env>` once its region is back | RTO 1–2 days (acceptable for this service class) |
