| **3 Research** | Each feature has its own proposal and cost check before build |

## 10.2 Validation spikes

| ID | Question | Method | Output |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| **S-1** | How big is the corpus really (pages, text bytes, languages)? Which bulk endpoints and formats exist, and what are the rate limits? | Download 20 batches across eras; measure; read the Datasets portal docs; email `ndnptech@loc.gov` about bulk etiquette | Sizing sheet; updated [04](04-data-sources-and-ingestion.md). **Done** (§4.1.1): 2,997 batches, 23.7M pages, 2.47 TB of archives, a machine-readable batch list with checksums; ~22 h of curation with 8 workers by CPU; LoC's bulk download limit makes it ~2.5 days (04 §4.4) |
| **S-2** | Quickwit vs Azure AI Search on our query shape | 1M-page sample in both; benchmark set ([05 §5.8](05-search-and-storage.md#58-benchmark-query-set-spike-s-2)); verify pre-1970 timestamps, fuzzy, slop, snippets, multi-index search and aggregations across a base + up to 8 sealed deltas, nested-aggregation memory and latency at `aggregation_bucket_limit: 200000` / `aggregation_memory_limit: 768MB` with place-shard splitting, managed-identity Blob auth in Quickwit, and split-cache behavior on Container Apps | Benchmark report; final [ADR-0001](adr/0001-search-engine.md). **Done:** correctness on the fixtures (dates, slop, snippets, sorting, multi-index search, sharded aggregations; fuzzy unsupported), the polling read-only searcher, and the auth design. See [05 §5.5.1](05-search-and-storage.md#551-quickwit-index-config-validated-in-s-2) and [08 §8.2](08-azure-infrastructure.md#82-identity-and-access-managed-identities-everywhere). **Open:** the 1M-page benchmark and auth against a real account |
| **S-3** | Geocoding quality from LoC metadata + GNIS | Resolve all titles; diff against legacy `town_ref.csv`; manually review outliers | `catalog/overrides/places.json` (in git); precision stats |
| **S-4** | Playback performance on low-end devices | Synthetic worst-case cube (3,000 × 211) on a low-end Android device and an older iPhone | Adjust the budget or thin the cube |

## 10.3 Risk register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| R-1 | **Sustainability again**: the maintainer leaves and the bills lapse | Med | High | < $80/mo (fits a personal card); IaC; runbooks; ≥ 2 admins ([ADR-0005](adr/0005-sustainability-constraints.md)) | Maintainer |
| R-2 | Quickwit fails S-2 (latency on high-frequency terms, pre-1970 dates, cache limits) | Med | Med | Integer bucket fields; Dedicated workload profile; fallback to Elastic on Azure or AI Search via the `SearchBackend` trait | Eng |
| R-3 | AI Search chosen, but budget can't sustain ~$3–6k/mo | Med (if chosen) | High | Choose A only if the budget covers it long term; otherwise B | Maintainer |
| R-4 | LoC changes bulk formats or endpoints again (as in 2025) | Med | Med | The curated lake decouples the site from the source, so the site keeps serving; a parser schema check in `discover`; follow the NDNP news feed | Eng |
| R-5 | Bulk download throttled; backfill slow. Archives not in LoC's CDN cache downloaded at 0.3–1.2 MB/s in the September 2026 trial (04 §4.1.2) | High | Med | Measure a cache-miss download from Azure before the backfill; start early; respect limits; validated mirror as accelerator; the backfill is one-time | Eng |
| R-6 | Quickwit project cadence slows after the acquisition | Low–Med | Med | Apache-2.0; pin versions; Tantivy maintained independently; backend abstraction | Eng |
| R-7 | Abuse or bot traffic causes cost spikes or slowness | Med | Med | Replica cap (bounds cost); API rate limits; caches; budget alerts; add Front Door (growth profile) or a free external CDN if abuse persists | Eng |
| R-12 | **ACI Spot is a preview** (no SLA, 3 regions, may change or be withdrawn) | Med | Low | Only offline jobs use it; the same image runs on regular ACI or on a Batch Spot pool; the work is idempotent and resumable | Eng |
| R-13 | **Lean searcher too slow** for high-frequency terms | Med | Med | Blob cache + pre-warm; a 202 and polling for searches over 10 s; the searcher moved to 2 vCPU / 4 GiB in October 2026 (+$15–30; exceeds $80 together with private networking) | Eng |
| R-14 | **Public-access window left open** after a failed backfill | Low | Med | Azure Policy denies public network access on the data accounts, so a window needs an explicit exemption; access still requires Entra tokens (keys disabled by policy). Removing the exemption does not close an account that is already open, so any Spot design must still include an in-VNet job that disables public access when the window ends | Eng |
| R-15 | Quickwit 0.9 has no fuzzy term queries, so F-21 (OCR-tolerant matching) can't be passed through (S-2) | High (confirmed) | Med | The API refuses fuzzy queries on Quickwit rather than miscount. Planned: expand a fuzzy term in the API into an `OR` of up to N real index terms within edit distance 1–2, using a term dictionary (FST) built with each index version; or wait for upstream support | Eng |
| R-16 | The full index build runs past the ingest job's 24 h `replicaTimeout`, which has no retry. The single-node writer ingests at most 20 MB/s per shard; the trial built ~560 pages/s on 8 laptop cores (04 §4.1.2) | Med | Med | Measure the build rate on the job's 2 vCPU with a large batch set; if needed, raise the job's CPU or timeout for the backfill, or build the base in parts | Eng |
| R-17 | **Unmerged splits make cold searches slow, and the writer's disk fills.** The September 2026 releases committed every 10 s and exited about 30 s after ingest, so indexes were left in many small splits (cold searches cost 4.5–5 s whatever the match count); two deltas filled the writer's disk, killing indexers and failing merges | High (confirmed) | Med | Batch ingest settings and a `limit_merge` policy with a 60,000-page target (a million pages ran the writer out of memory while uploading, October 2026, and the common-word pairs make pages 1.6× larger; 08 §8.4), so the corpus is about 360 splits; the release waits for merges, closes the index after its final merges, and fails rather than publish half merged, on a full disk or when the writer dies (naming an out-of-memory kill); split counts per index in the log and the manifest (05 §5.5.1). A 128 GiB NFS scratch share for the writer (08 §8.4, about $21/month). The merge wait adds up to 4 hours to a release (about 1.7 h for a full rebuild, R-16). Indexes built before the fix keep their splits until a full release rebuilds them | Eng |
| R-8 | OCR quality misleads users (false negatives) | High | Med | OCR-tolerant mode; "pages containing" wording; improved NDNP-Open-OCR re-ingestion; methodology page | Product |
| R-9 | Geographic misattribution (titles that moved; county-level fallbacks) | Med | Low | Precision flags; date-ranged places; overrides reviewed in PRs | Eng |
| R-10 | Rust maintainer pool is thin | Low–Med | Med | Small, well-tested API; OpenAPI contract; documented rewrite path ([ADR-0004](adr/0004-rust-api.md)) | Maintainer |
| R-11 | Legacy secrets in the public legacy repo are still valid | Low | Med | **Closed (October 2026):** the Google Places key and Mapbox token were revoked in their consoles. No history rewrite: the keys were already exposed, so revocation is what matters | Maintainer |

## 10.4 Open questions for the maintainer

1. **Speed vs budget.** At the $80 ceiling, Quickwit on a 1–2 vCPU sidecar is the only search option; managed AI Search (~$2–6k/mo) is out of reach. Are slower uncached searches for very common words (5–15 s) acceptable, or should the searcher start at 2 vCPU / 4 GiB? With private networking (~$17/mo, [ADR-0008](adr/0008-private-networking.md)) the 2 vCPU option puts a typical month at ~$87–102, over $80. The choices are: raise the ceiling to ~$100; keep private networking and the 1 vCPU searcher (~$72); or trade private endpoints for search speed.
2. **Branding and credits.** Keep the "US News Map" name and credit the original GTRI and eHistory team and Prof. Saunt?
3. **Domain.** Confirm control of `usnewsmap.com` (the registrar account), and whether `usnewsmap.net` (used for legacy Solr hosts) is still held.
4. **Legacy repo.** Archive `tgoodyear/usnewsmap` with a README pointing to the new project, after revoking the exposed keys.
5. **Scope of the public API.** Anonymous-only with fair-use limits, or issue keys to researchers for higher limits?
6. **Analytics.** Is App Insights custom-event analytics enough, or is a privacy-friendly product analytics tool wanted?
