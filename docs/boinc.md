# BOINC batch pilot

An opt-in worker pool for trusted friends, alongside the on-prem OCR nodes.
Design issue: [#438](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/438).
The pilot uses stock BOINC, one cached page per task, and the repository's
Tesseract 5.5.0/model lock and language routing. It publishes native ALTO and
Parquet to `ocr-out`; `ocr-sync` and the release keep their existing decisions.

## Boundaries

- Linux x86-64 first, with compatible recent stock BOINC and Docker. The stock
  Docker wrapper is the only app type in this pilot. Volunteers need permission
  to run Docker containers; hosts without that capability (including restricted
  or unprivileged containers) cannot participate. A native app is future work.
- Explicit cohorts of 1-100 pages from one batch, selected from the prefetch
  manifest. No automatic consumption of Azure queues or LoC fetching.
- Central bridge: native work reservations, BOINC staging/submission, validation
  and publishing. Only it can access Azure through the existing Entra credential
  path. Volunteers get images and processing metadata, never credentials.
- Separate job/result file transport, version 1, from the planned ADR-0016
  long-lived engine protocol. Engine provenance remains `contract=0` with
  `route=boinc@r1`; models and routing are shared with the current worker.
- A task's container runs Tesseract directly. There is no nested Podman/Docker
  daemon. BOINC's Docker wrapper controls the outer container.

```
explicit page selection + cached scans
  -> native requested-work reservation + local dispatch journal
  -> stock BOINC -> pinned worker container
  -> stock batch_collect_assimilator spool
  -> usnm-boinc collect -> native ALTO/Parquet in ocr-out
  -> existing ocr-sync -> existing release/index
```

## Build the worker image

First build the existing engine image. Keep its pinned base, package snapshot,
and `models.lock`, including `frak2021`; the BOINC worker verifies the selected
models' bytes at execution. Then build the BOINC image using that engine image's
immutable digest (these examples run from the repository root):

```sh
docker build -f ocr/engines/tesseract/Containerfile \
  -t usnm-tesseract:pilot ocr/engines/tesseract
docker image inspect usnm-tesseract:pilot --format '{{.Id}}'

docker build -f ocr/boinc/Containerfile \
  --build-arg TESSERACT_IMAGE=sha256:ENGINE_IMAGE_ID \
  -t usnm-boinc:pilot .
```

Replace the placeholder with the full engine image ID. For remote volunteers,
publish the BOINC image to a registry they can pull, and use its registry digest:
`registry.example.org/usnm/boinc@sha256:FULL_DIGEST`. Record the full worker-image
pin, not the engine base's pin. The registry is operator-supplied; this PR does
not publish an image. Choose a registry such as GHCR or Docker Hub and verify an
anonymous pull by the volunteer runtime before submitting work. The example
registry below is a placeholder, not a deployed service. Rebuild/sign a new BOINC app version when changing
code, models, image, or runtime configuration. The Rust build uses the repository's
locked dependencies; capture the build revision and compiler in your release.

Before changing the installed worker image, stop creating new cohorts. Finish
exporting/submitting already allocated cohorts with their original image, and
drain all existing workunits through collection. Resolve uncertain and failed tasks before
rolling the app version; do not send their existing requests to a different image.
The worker checks the exact Tesseract version, profile and model bytes, and the
collector checks the result against the job's immutable engine metadata. Installing
a new app version does not rewrite existing requests or bind `create_work` to an
image automatically. Resume with fresh cohorts and the new image pin after the
old cohort is drained. Retain old signed files and journals for recovery.

## Local synthetic demonstration

Requires Rust and the worker image above. `pilot_fixture` creates a rendered
`HELLO WORLD` page plus native manifest, sidecar, curated/reference stores, and
file-backed state. It makes no network requests and contains no production data.
Use a fresh directory:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p usnm-boinc --example pilot_fixture -- --dir /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo
cargo build --locked -p usnm-boinc

target/debug/usnm-boinc export \
  --manifest /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/manifest.parquet \
  --pages /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/pages.txt --batch test_pilot \
  --scans /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/scans --root /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/dispatch \
  --plan pilot-demo --image sha256:WORKER_IMAGE_ID \
  --curated-url /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/curated \
  --reference-url /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/reference \
  --state-file /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/state.json
```

The exporter prints a job ID. Run its directory through the worker image:

```sh
docker run --rm --network=none --read-only --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=DAC_OVERRIDE \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cpus=1 --memory=1536m \
  --memory-swap=1536m --pids-limit=64 --tmpfs=/tmp:rw,size=512m \
  -v /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/dispatch/jobs/JOB_ID:/work usnm-boinc:pilot
```

On SELinux hosts, label only this scratch directory appropriately (e.g. a `:Z`
volume). The stock spool names are `<workunit>__file_<logical_name>`; for this
local test copy the three output files into a scratch spool with that naming,
where the workunit is `usnm_JOB_ID`, then run:

```sh
target/debug/usnm-boinc collect --root /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/dispatch \
  --spool /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/spool --job JOB_ID \
  --curated-url /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/curated --out-url /tmp/usnm-boinc-demo/out
```

Run it twice: publication remains one ALTO/Parquet pair. The Rust integration
suite also runs these outputs through the real `ocr-sync` in directory mode:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p usnm-boinc
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/boinc -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Connect a stock BOINC project

Create your own Linux BOINC project server using the upstream setup documentation.
Stock means unmodified upstream BOINC software: BOINC Central hosting or public
project registration is not required. Friends attach manually to your server's
project URL. Registering `usnm_ocr` below means registering it on your own server.
This repository does not provision its web server/database or ship BOINC binaries.
Use BOINC 9.0+ clients and a recent Linux x86-64 `docker_wrapper` supporting
`workdir` and `create_args`. Install/merge upstream's Docker plan class and test
that the requested runtime limits, pause/resume, and output permissions work.
The minimal CPU `docker` class from the upstream sample is supplied in
`ocr/boinc/plan_class_spec.xml`: copy it into a project without a plan-class file,
or merge its class into an existing file, retaining the other classes. Restart
project daemons after changing the project configuration. Installing an app
version alone does not install its scheduler plan class.

The current stock wrapper source parses `workdir` as the slot's container mount
path and appends `create_args` to `docker create` (these fields are absent from
some published job-file docs). Pin and record the wrapper's source revision and
binary hash, and verify its behavior in the live acceptance exercise; an older
wrapper may ignore these settings. See the linked wrapper source.

`job.toml` drops all capabilities except `DAC_OVERRIDE`, which allows the
container's UID 0 to read/write the BOINC-owned slot without changing the host
slot permissions. Root with all capabilities dropped cannot reliably do that
when the slot and input files belong to another UID. The root filesystem stays
read-only, networking is disabled, and the slot is the only configured host mount.
Outputs and `fraction_done` are mode 0644 so the client can read them. This has
been checked with an OCI runtime and a deliberately foreign-owned slot; it still
needs confirmation through the actual BOINC wrapper on each supported host.

Register the application `usnm_ocr` in the BOINC admin interface. Install an app
candidate using a trusted stock wrapper and the pullable worker image digest:

```sh
python3 scripts/boinc/install.py --project /srv/boinc/newspapers \
  --wrapper /path/to/docker_wrapper \
  --image registry.example.org/usnm/boinc@sha256:FULL_DIGEST --version 1.0
```

The installer refuses an existing version directory. It does not alter running
server configuration. Sign/publish its files using BOINC's normal code-signing
process and `bin/update_versions`. Merge `ocr/boinc/daemons.xml` into the existing
`config.xml` daemons section and restart the project daemons. This file is a
fragment, not a replacement list: retain the stock feeder, transitioner,
file_deleter, db_purge and other standard daemons. The separate hosting work in
[#439](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/pull/439) supplies server deployment
and bootstrap configuration; it is not a prerequisite for self-hosting.

`sample_trivial_validator` accepts results for this trusted-friends pilot; it
is not an accuracy/security check. `batch_collect_assimilator` moves canonical
outputs to `results/0/<workunit>__file_<logical_name>` and records terminal errors
there. Our central collector validates every result before publishing. Keep the
spool until central publication succeeds. A partial/missing spool is refused;
inspect BOINC logs and recover its files rather than accepting a partial result.

Export a real allocated cohort using its native prefetch manifest, canonical
page-key list, cached scan root, and curated/reference stores. For Azure state use `--cosmos`
in place of `--state-file`, with the same Entra identity/store settings as ingest.
The image flag is the full `sha256:...` digest corresponding to the installed app.
Then submit each exported job:

```sh
target/debug/usnm-boinc submit --root /srv/usnm/boinc-state \
  --project /srv/boinc/newspapers --job JOB_ID
```

Attach one friend's stock BOINC client to the project. Configure idle-only
processing and conservative preferences, and update the project. After the task
uploads and the assimilator spools it:

```sh
target/debug/usnm-boinc collect --root /srv/usnm/boinc-state \
  --spool /srv/boinc/newspapers/results/0 --job JOB_ID \
  --curated-url CURATED_STORE --out-url OCR_OUT_STORE
```

A `published` bridge entry means its native output pair is in `ocr-out`, not that
it has replaced searchable text. Continue with the existing `ocr-sync` and release.

## Server and maintainer on different hosts

The bridge has no remote-submit API. `submit`/`reconcile` must run on the BOINC
server host where the project tree and database are reachable. `export`/`collect`
can run on the maintainer's host with its existing Entra access. The original
prefetch scan cache stays there: the dispatch root's `jobs/` already contains the
input snapshots the server needs.

For a small pilot, use a manual hand-off over a trusted transfer channel:

1. Export the allocated cohort locally, stop bridge writers for that dispatch
   root, and transfer its complete `jobs/` tree into a fresh server-local dispatch
   root. Preserve file bytes and journal timestamps; do not transfer a live lock
   or regenerate requests. Keep the frozen original as a backup.
2. Make the server copy the sole writable journal. Submit using that root and
   the local BOINC project. If submission becomes uncertain, inspect/reconcile
   on the server before transferring control again.
3. Stop server bridge writers and transfer the updated complete journal tree
   back into a fresh maintainer-local root. Transfer the matching assimilator
   spool files, including any terminal error markers. Retain the server copy
   and spool until publication is confirmed. Run `collect` against this updated
   root and the copied spool, then native `ocr-sync` as usual.
4. Transfer control again only after freezing the current writer. Do not merge
   diverging journals or run both copies concurrently: local `flock` does not
   serialize separate machines. An old backup cannot establish that a job was
   never submitted; inspect the server and preserve uncertain state.

This is a manual single-writer protocol, not tested remote orchestration. Keep
journals on persistent local storage at each stage; Azure Files/SMB lock and
atomic-rename durability have not been verified. Exercise the hand-off on a
small cohort before using the Azure-hosted submission job from #439.

## Allocation and recovery

Export filters the manifest while decoding, retaining only selected batch/page
rows (the native decoder still validates all rows). Undetected page languages
use the title's first catalog language from the published reference snapshot,
using the same MARC-to-ISO mapping as native enqueue. BOINC eligibility is stricter:
only titles present in this version's `titles.json` are eligible. The mutable
`catalog/titles.json` cannot make an unpublished title eligible. Published version
IDs must be safe single path segments before any snapshot objects are read.

Export stages all selected jobs locally before reserving the cohort under one
renewable `ocr-sync` lock. It reads the published metadata and native ledger once,
validates the whole cohort, and writes one create-only queued part for fresh
reservations. If any row conflicts, no new reservations are written. It verifies
that the published version has not changed since staging, checks batch/version
and title against that snapshot, and leaves Japanese titles to their
existing pipeline. It refuses pages with prior native work, except an
exact replay of its own reservation. "Fresh cohort" means different page keys
without prior native work. Both outstanding and completed native work make a
page ineligible; changing the plan, image pin, timeout or job ID does not bypass
this check. The ledger remains
outstanding across BOINC processing; no Azure queue lease is held or renewed. Allocate a fresh small cohort,
and exclude it from overlapping seeder plans: the existing seeder may reconsider
old outstanding work under its own policy. This pilot does not add a global
long-lived BOINC ownership field to that policy.

The local journal has `prepared`, `reserved`, `submitting`, `submitted`,
`published`, and `failed` states. Keep it on persistent local storage and back it
up. An advisory lock serializes bridge processes sharing that directory.

- Repeating export completes a reservation interrupted by a crash, without writing
  another request. A lost cohort-write response or partially updated local
  journals replay the exact existing rows and reserve only still-fresh pages.
  The original request time is retained at native microsecond precision.
- Before `create_work`, submission records `submitting`. After an error or crash
  it never automatically submits again. Inspect BOINC for `usnm_JOB_ID`. Only
  after verifying existence/absence run `reconcile --root DIR --job ID --found
present` (mark submitted) or `--found absent` (permit submission again).
- The importer snapshots the first accepted bytes before external publication.
  Fixed object names and byte comparisons recover a lost upload response or a
  crash between ALTO and Parquet. Conflicting preexisting bytes stop publication.
  Native import outcomes recover a lost local commit after `ocr-sync` consumed
  the objects. A completed import is never republished from another callback.
- A terminal BOINC error sets `failed`. Preserve the native reservation and
  diagnose it with BOINC's server tools. This first pilot has no automatic
  reallocation. After recovering the same workunit on the server, preserve then
  remove its stale spool error marker and use `reconcile --root DIR --job ID
--found present` to permit collection of its recovered output. A failed job
  cannot be marked absent to create a duplicate workunit. Alternatively arrange
  a new native allocation through the existing pipeline. Do not reset a
  submitted/failed task blindly. There is no supported "re-export this failed
  page with a new BOINC job ID" command. To move the page back to the native pool,
  first ensure BOINC can no longer return or collect it, retain its journal and
  spool for audit, then use the existing
  [native enqueue/requeue procedure](operations.md#ocr-pickup-ocr-sync-296) with an
  operator-approved `ocr-enqueue --include-outstanding` retry for that page.
  `ocr-requeue` targets native dead letters, not BOINC spool error markers. Never
  delete ledger history to make the page appear fresh.
- Keep `keep/` scans. Do not delete `buffer/` scans from a volunteer claim or task
  completion. The exporter snapshots inputs centrally and never deletes originals.
- No in-page checkpointing: restart can repeat a page. BOINC resource estimates
  are initial bounds; calibrate them on real scans. One-hour maximum configurable
  OCR deadline, default 600 seconds, one Tesseract thread, PSM 3/DPI 300. The
  fixed `rsc_fpops_est=1e12` is provisional, so client ETA and credit are rough;
  use `elapsed_ms` from returned manifests across real JPEG/JP2 scans to calibrate
  it. `target_nresults=1` requests one result. `max_success_results=3` is a failure
  ceiling, not a request for three copies; stock BOINC cancels unsent copies once
  it finds a canonical result. These retry ceilings remain unchanged pending
  live recovery measurements. The 1.5 GiB memory bound is provisional and has
  only been exercised on a synthetic page; peak memory for large historical JP2
  decode plus Tesseract is unmeasured. Record peak memory and time on the largest
  intended scans before widening enrollment or raising batch volume. A resource
  limit failure is a failed task, not evidence of a usable OCR result.

Result identity/provenance fields and checksums establish transport consistency,
not proof that a volunteer actually ran the declared image. Trusted friends are
a prerequisite; public enrollment requires stronger validation. Raising quorum
alone with `sample_trivial_validator` does not compare OCR output. A future audit
or comparative validator could rerun sampled pages and compare text, after
measuring determinism across supported hosts, or check a trusted reference set.
No hand-transcribed historical accuracy measurement is implied by the synthetic smoke test. The
optional comparative validator is being developed separately in
[#444](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/pull/444); it is not part of this
pilot's default validator or a claim of public-volunteer readiness.

## Live acceptance exercise

Complete one real stock-client/server task, then test keyboard activity pause,
sleep/reboot, a missing result file, a wrong checksum, an importer restart and
repeat collection. Confirm the wrapper applies `create_args` and all three outputs
are readable by the host client. Include a slot owned by the BOINC service user
with restrictive directory/input modes, not only a directory owned by the runtime
user; confirm `DAC_OVERRIDE` and the file modes work as intended. Record server/client/wrapper/image versions and
which platforms were tested. Local native-pipeline tests do not establish BOINC
scheduler or OS-specific idle behavior.

## Gold check

A volunteer host can score its engine on the public gold bundle
([ocr-gold-set.md](ocr-gold-set.md#volunteer-bundle), #457) and report CER and
WER together with the bundle version. Two steps, because the task container
runs with `--network=none`:

```sh
# On the host, with network: verify the bundle, download the original files it
# names (BLN600's zip from figshare, page images from loc.gov) into a cache, and
# keep each only if its sha256 matches. Downloads are one at a time, 1 s apart.
usnm-boinc gold-stage --bundle usnm-ocr-gold-v1.tar --cache CACHE --work WORK

# Offline: verify the bundle again, check the cache, cut the crops locally, run
# Tesseract on each, score as gold.py does, and write the report.
usnm-boinc gold-run --bundle usnm-ocr-gold-v1.tar --cache CACHE --work WORK \
  --out gold-result.json [--tesseract tesseract] [--psm 3] [--dpi 300] [--limit N]
```

`gold-result.json` holds `bundle_version`, the manifest's sha256, the engine
(name, version, psm, dpi), one row per crop (counts only: reference characters,
character edits, reference words, word edits, the model profile and the time),
a summary per source and overall, and the crops that were skipped with the
reason (not staged, checksum mismatch, no installed model, engine error). It
holds no page text and no transcription. The project ships no BLN600 crop and
no LoC image: the client gets them from their publishers and cuts them itself.

Not built yet: sending the gold check as BOINC work (an app version or a task
type, how the bundle and cache reach the container, and where the reports go).
That is tracked in #462.
