## Design

The [design documents](design/README.md) (01–11) record the background, requirements and architecture, and the reasoning behind each part of the system; the [architecture decision records](design/adr/README.md) record each major decision and the alternatives rejected. References such as "05 §5.5.1" in the code and docs point into them.

## Notes

The [technical notes](notes/README.md) are dated write-ups of work on the index, the OCR and the corpus's coverage: what was tried, what was measured, what was decided and what is left. The design documents say how the system stands now; a note says what was true when.

- [BOINC batch pilot](boinc.md): opt-in cached-page volunteer processing and recovery.
- [Linux BOINC quick start](boinc-linux.md): account, per-node setup and headless cluster attachment.
