# Releasing a BOINC app version

`scripts/boinc-app-release.sh` builds, stages, signs and publishes one app version on the
live server in one command:

```sh
scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_ocr --version 1.0 --signing-host HOST --what-if
scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_ocr --version 1.0 --signing-host HOST
```

`--signing-key-dir` (default `/usbbak/signing/boinc`) and `--signing-dataset` (default
`usbbak/signing`) name where the private key is on the signing host. `--what-if` runs the
read-only checks and prints the plan.

`usnm_ocr`, `usnm_assess`, `usnm_gold` and `usnm_quality` use `--plan-class docker` (the
default) and `images.worker` from `infra/boinc/env/<env>.json`. `usnm_surya` (#516) and
`usnm_qwen` (#522) have their own worker images (`.github/workflows/boinc-surya.yml` and
`.github/workflows/boinc-qwen.yml`) and two plan classes (`docker_mt` for version `1.0`,
`docker_nvidia_cuda` for version `1.1`), passed with `--plan-class` and `--worker-image`:

```sh
scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_quality --version 1.0 --signing-host HOST
scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_qwen --version 1.0 --plan-class docker_mt \
  --worker-image ghcr.io/tgoodyear/usnm-boinc-worker@sha256:... --signing-host HOST
scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_qwen --version 1.1 --plan-class docker_nvidia_cuda \
  --worker-image ghcr.io/tgoodyear/usnm-boinc-worker@sha256:... --signing-host HOST
```

## What it needs

- The server and bridge images in `infra/boinc/env/<env>.json` (`scripts/build-boinc-images.sh`).
  Provisioning ensures the project is initialised automatically.
- `codeSignPublicKey` in the settings: the public half of the key on the signing host.
- `images.worker`: the public GHCR worker image, by digest (below).
- SSH as root to the signing host, with the key's dataset unlocked by hand:
  `zfs load-key usbbak/signing && zfs mount usbbak/signing`. The script never unlocks it.
- podman on the signing host.

```

1. **Worker image.** Volunteers' Docker pulls it, so it must be public, and the project's ACR
   has no anonymous pull (ADR-0019, addendum). `.github/workflows/boinc-worker.yml` builds the
   Tesseract engine and `ocr/boinc/Containerfile` on it and pushes
   `ghcr.io/tgoodyear/usnm-boinc-worker`; it runs by hand from main and writes the digest to the
   run's summary. Make the package public once in its settings, put the digest in
   `images.worker`, and commit. The script checks that an anonymous client can read that
   digest. With `images.worker` empty it builds the engine and worker in ACR Tasks instead
   (cached by input key), as a build check, and stops.
2. **Stage.** The server image goes to the signing host with a short-lived ACR pull token
   (deleted after the pull). `scripts/boinc/install.py` and `ocr/boinc/`, from the committed
   HEAD, run in it with `--network=none` and write
   `apps/<app>/<version>/<platform>__docker/` (`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu` by default) (wrapper, `job.toml`, a `Dockerfile`
   pinned to the worker digest, `version.xml`).
3. **Sign.** BOINC's `sign_executable` runs in the server image with `--network=none` and the
   key directory mounted read-only, and signs every file but `version.xml`. Only the `.sig`
   files come back. The work directory on the signing host is removed on exit.
4. **Publish.** ACR Tasks builds `usnm-boinc-appver:<app>-<version>` from
   `contrib-compute/images/appver/`: the server image with the version directory staged again
   from the same inputs, the `.sig` files added, and the result checked by
   `check_appver.py`. The build fails on a `.sig` with no staged file, a staged file without a
   `.sig`, anything in the signatures that isn't a `.sig`, a `version.xml` that names a file
   that wasn't staged, or a signature that `crypt_prog -verify` rejects against
   `codeSignPublicKey`. `provision-boinc.sh --publish-image <digest>` deploys and runs the job
   `usnm-boinc-publish-caj-<env>` with that image (it has the share, the database and the vault,
   as the init job does). The job copies the version to the share,
   installs the app's templates, copies the committed project metadata, runs `bin/xadd`
   to register platforms, and runs the unmodified `bin/update_versions --noconfirm` in a
   temporary layout containing only the requested app/version/platform. The configuration
   still names the real download and key directories. It explicitly verifies the exact
   database app-version row before notifying the feeder: PHP `die(string)` can otherwise
   exit zero even though registration failed. A platform already on
   the share must be identical, byte for byte (`diff -r`): a rerun with changed bytes is refused,
   because versions are immutable and a change is a new version. The
   script then writes the image's digest to `images.appver` in the settings; commit it. Every
   `provision-boinc.sh` deploys and runs the publish job on `images.appver`, so the job stays and always
   holds the last published version (rerunning it is safe: it changes nothing when the version
   is already there). `--publish-image` overrides it for one deployment. Provisioning also
   ensures secrets, skips a completed project initialization, registers apps and checks the
   public project configuration. It refuses to overwrite partial project data or an existing
   database, and never prints a manual bootstrap checklist.

Deployment previews use GA `az stack-whatif group create`, with the same unmanage and deny
settings as deployment, three-hour retention and Azure's baseline-based noise reduction.
Existing managed-identity principal IDs are resolved before template evaluation so role
assignment IDs remain unchanged and deterministic. Preview results still require review;
noise reduction is not evidence that all differences are real or safe.

## Test client

An end-to-end test needs a BOINC client with Docker (and an NVIDIA GPU for `docker_nvidia_cuda`
versions), attached to the master URL with a test account, that downloads a staged workunit
and returns a result that validates and is assimilated (#484). Container Apps and ACI cannot
run Docker in a container, so `scripts/boinc-test-client.sh` and
`contrib-compute/infra/boinc/test-client.bicep` deploy a short-lived VM in its own resource
group (`usnm-boinc-test-rg-<env>`) and delete the group when the test is done:

```sh
scripts/boinc-test-client.sh --env prod --create [--sku Standard_NC4as_T4_v3] [--spot|--paygo] \
  [--authenticator-file <path>] [--what-if]
scripts/boinc-test-client.sh --env prod --delete [--what-if]
```

Flags:

- `--env <prod|dev>`: reads subscription, location and `projectUrl` from
  `contrib-compute/infra/boinc/env/<env>.json`, and checks that the `usnm-boinc-<env>` stack is
  deployed.
- `--create`: creates `usnm-boinc-test-rg-<env>` and deploys
  `contrib-compute/infra/boinc/test-client.bicep`. By default, cloud-init creates a fresh
  disposable test volunteer account on the server with `boinccmd --create_account`; if
  `--authenticator-file <PATH>` is given, the script reads that file into a mode-`0600`
  `@params` file and passes it to the `@secure()` `projectAuthenticator` parameter without
  putting the value in process arguments or stdout.
- `--delete`: deletes the resource group `usnm-boinc-test-rg-<env>` and everything in it, so
  nothing stands between tests.
- `--sku <SKU>`: Azure VM size (default `Standard_NC4as_T4_v3`, 4 vCPUs, 28 GiB RAM, 1x NVIDIA
  T4 16 GiB, which exercises `docker`, `docker_mt` and `docker_nvidia_cuda`).
- `--spot` / `--paygo`: deploys as an Azure Spot VM with `Delete` eviction policy (`--spot`,
  the default) or a regular pay-as-you-go VM (`--paygo`).
- `--what-if`: checks settings and prints the plan without creating or deleting resources.

`contrib-compute/infra/boinc/test-client.bicep` provisions an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86-64 VM in
its own VNet (`100.64.0.0/24`, RFC 6598 shared address space) with an NSG that denies all
inbound traffic; outbound HTTPS reaches `https://<masterHost>/usnmocr/`, `ghcr.io`, and the
Ubuntu, BOINC (`https://boinc.berkeley.edu/dl/linux/stable/noble`), and NVIDIA package
repositories. Cloud-init installs Docker, `boinc-client` (>= 8.2.13 from the upstream BOINC
noble repository, using `/var/lib/boinc`), and (when an NVIDIA GPU is present) the NVIDIA
driver and `nvidia-container-toolkit`, adds `boinc` to the `docker` group, starts the client,
creates a disposable account when `projectAuthenticator` is empty, and runs
`boinccmd --project_attach https://<masterHost>/usnmocr/ <authenticator>`.

UNVERIFIED against a live deployment: cloud-init package installation, GPU detection by
`boinc-client`, workunit execution on the VM, and end-to-end result assimilation.
Automated release-to-client acceptance orchestration is tracked in
[#548](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/548); app registration and public
health are not a substitute for execution and canonical assimilation.

## Mac app versions

Contribute build scripts and public settings through a PR. Runtime changes made
inside the Container App disappear on rebuild. A contributor can build and test
native ARM workers and wrappers without server or signing-key access; the
maintainer publishes and signs from the merged commit.

1. Merge the native build changes, then dispatch `boinc-worker.yml` from `main`.
   Verify both architecture checks and anonymous pulls, and commit its index
   digest as `images.worker` through a PR. Follow the cohort drain procedure in
   [docs/boinc.md](../../docs/boinc.md#publish-the-worker-image).
2. Dispatch `boinc-mac-wrapper.yml` from the same reviewed commit. Download the
   `boinc-mac-wrappers` artifact: `docker_wrapper_arm64`, `docker_wrapper_x86_64`,
   `BOINC_COMMIT`, and `SHA256SUMS`. Alternatively, on a Mac with Xcode:

   ```sh
   bash scripts/boinc/build-mac-wrapper.sh --out /tmp/mac-wrappers
   ```

   The script checks out exactly the BOINC commit pinned by the server
   Containerfile, builds both Mach-O executables and records checksums. The
   artifact is a BOINC code-signing candidate, not an Apple-notarized installer.
   A checksum and source-pin file check integrity and consistency; use artifacts
   from a trusted, reviewed build. Record the workflow run, commit and SDK in the
   release evidence.

3. On the maintainer's checkout, verify the artifact checksums and use the
   existing offline-signing release path with the selected platform:

   ```sh
   (cd /tmp/mac-wrappers && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
   # Run from the clean repository checkout, using the checked checksum below.
   scripts/boinc-app-release.sh --env prod --app usnm_ocr --version 1.1 \
     --signing-host HOST --platform arm64-apple-darwin \
     --wrapper /tmp/mac-wrappers/docker_wrapper_arm64 \
     --wrapper-sha256 CHECKED_SHA256 \
     --wrapper-source-pin /tmp/mac-wrappers/BOINC_COMMIT --what-if
   ```

   Remove `--what-if` to stage, sign and publish. For Intel Mac use
   `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `docker_wrapper_x86_64`. The script requires a worker
   index containing the corresponding native Linux child, validates wrapper
   architecture/checksum/source pin, and signs the frozen bytes on the signing
   host. Mac binaries are never executed on that Linux host. A new platform can
   share a version number only when its shared templates agree; existing
   platform files remain immutable. Changed image, wrapper or job configuration
   requires a new version. Commit the resulting `images.appver` setting.

4. Reserve a synthetic/cached-page `usnm_ocr` job for an ARM Mac client, then
   verify scheduler selection, signed download, native execution, upload,
   validation, assimilation and bridge collection. Repeat on an Intel Mac when
   available. Check pause/resume, client restart and reboot, then run a matched
   gold campaign before calling Mac support complete.

The standalone Mac spike found an upstream `Run_Podman` command-quoting failure
when restarting a paused container. Native image execution succeeds; BOINC
lifecycle behavior still needs a tested fix and full client/server validation.
See [#476](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/issues/476) and the separate
[BUDA evaluation PR #503](https://github.com/tgoodyear/usnewsmap.com/pull/503).
These release tools contribute to #476 without closing it or the BUDA spike #481.
