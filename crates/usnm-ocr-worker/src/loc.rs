//! Page scans from the Library of Congress.
//!
//! **The batch route** (#368, the fetcher's first choice): a page's original
//! JP2 from its batch's directory on `tile.loc.gov`'s storage service
//! ([`crate::batch`]). One `manifest-md5.txt` per batch (kept on disk)
//! names every file and its md5; one METS per issue (kept on disk too)
//! maps seq to the JP2's frame number; the JP2 itself is checked against
//! the bag's md5. Its IIIF base is built from the same path. Nothing goes
//! to www.loc.gov. [`LocClient::resolve`] answers `None` when the batch,
//! the issue, its METS or the page isn't there, and only then does the
//! caller go to the item API.
//!
//! **The item API route** (the worker's, and the fetcher's fallback): for
//! each issue, one request to loc.gov's item JSON
//! (`https://www.loc.gov/item/{lccn}/{date}/ed-{n}/?fo=json`) gives every
//! page's JP2 file; its path names the page's IIIF service
//! (`https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:…`), and the scan is
//! that base plus `/full/full/0/default.jpg`. The item JSON is cached (LRU),
//! so the pages of one issue cost one API request.
//!
//! **Pacing.** loc.gov's API, its image server and its storage service are
//! each paced by a gap between requests shared by every task on the node
//! (the storage service shares the image server's pacer unless told it has
//! a budget of its own: LoC publishes a limit for each, but not whether
//! they are counted together). `Retry-After` is honoured on 429 and 503, a
//! 403 holds the server the same way (a block isn't the page's fault), and
//! every request names the site in its User-Agent. A hold is never worked
//! around: a page whose batch route is held fails as transient and doesn't
//! go to the item API.
//!
//! **Item errors** (#414). Some items answer 503 at once, for hours, while
//! the rest of loc.gov answers normally: a fault in that item on LoC's
//! side, not a hold. An item JSON 503, or a METS or JP2 503 on the storage
//! service, counts as an item error, with nothing held, only when all of
//! these are true:
//! - on the storage service, it is the second 503 for that file, after the
//!   first held the server as usual (503s under load look the same there);
//! - it came back within [`ITEM_ERROR_FAST`], with no `Retry-After`;
//! - another request to that server answered 2xx within
//!   [`ITEM_ERROR_OK_WITHIN`], or one paced request for the last small file
//!   that answered 2xx there (the *known-good* item) answers 2xx now;
//! - fewer than [`ITEM_ERROR_TITLES`] different titles, this one included,
//!   had item errors on that server in the last [`ITEM_ERROR_WINDOW`].
//!
//! Anything else (a 429, a 403, a `Retry-After`, a slow 503, a 503 on the
//! image server or for a batch manifest, a failed check, or item errors
//! spread over several titles) holds the server as before. When unsure, it
//! holds.
