//! `usnm-ocr-worker prefetch` (#368): fetch the scans a manifest lists
//! (`usnm_ocr_contract::prefetch`) onto a node's disk ahead of the workers,
//! so every engine reads the same local scan and LoC serves each image
//! once.
//!
//! **Fetching** goes through [`LocClient`], the worker's own client, batch
//! route first: the page's JP2 from its batch directory on LoC's storage
//! service, found through the batch's bag manifest and the issue's METS
//! (both kept on disk), and only for a page that route can't place, the
//! item API and the IIIF JPEG. The same User-Agent, 1 s between storage
//! requests (sharing the image server's budget unless told otherwise), 1 s
//! between image requests and 5 s between loc.gov API requests (shared by
//! every page in flight in this process),
//! `Retry-After` honoured on 429 and 503 and a 403 held the same way, at
//! most an hour. Nothing works around a block: after
//! [`Options::max_failures_in_a_row`] pages from at least
//! [`Options::stop_min_titles`] titles fail in a row the run stops.
//! A lock file in the output directory keeps it to one fetching process.
//!
//! **Mirrors** ([`Options::mirrors`], off unless named): a full-size JP2
//! the batch route has placed (LoC's METS gave its frame and the bag its
//! md5) is asked of a copy of LoC's files first: the state partner that
//! serves its awardee's batches, then the Wayback Machine
//! ([`crate::loc::mirror`]). Bytes that match the bag's md5 are taken with
//! LoC's URL and IIIF base, as LoC's own would be; anything else (a miss,
//! another file, a hold) goes on to LoC. Each mirror is paced and held on
//! its own, never in LoC's budget. A page a mirror served says nothing
//! about LoC, so it neither ends a run of failures nor clears a cool-off.
//! Where each mirrored page's bytes came from is in
//! `<out>/sources-<tag>.jsonl` ([`SourceLine`]); the sidecar is the same as
//! for LoC's.
//!
//! **LoC's bucket** ([`crate::loc::bucket`], off unless the client is given
//! it): LoC's own S3 copy of the batches it holds, asked before
//! `tile.loc.gov` for the bag manifest and the METS (inside the client) and
//! for a full-size JP2, before the mirrors. It is checked, recorded and
//! counted as a mirror is (`sources-<tag>.jsonl` with source
//! `ndnp-batches`, `fetched_bucket` and the status's `bucket`), and like a
//! mirror's, a page it served neither ends a run of failures nor clears a
//! cool-off: it says nothing about `tile.loc.gov`.
//!
//! **Item errors** (#414): when loc.gov answers 503 for one issue's item
//! while serving others ([`FetchError::Item`], the client's notes say when;
//! on the storage service, the issue's METS or a JP2), the issue's pages
//! are skipped on that route for [`Options::item_cooloff`] and asked
//! again after it, in the same run (it waits for them at the end) or the
//! next. After [`Options::item_max_cooloffs`] cool-offs the issue is
//! permanent. Each skipped page is a `loc_item_error` failure line; the
//! issues are kept in `<out>/item-errors.json` ([`ItemError`]) so a restart
//! keeps their cool-offs.
//!
//! **Two sets** (the maintainer's split, #368): the *keep* set, every
//! non-English page and the worst English batches' pages, is kept for good;
//! the *buffer* set, the rest of English, is a rolling buffer that the
//! workers empty as they read it (ADR-0015 decision 9). Keep pages are
//! fetched first, in [`priority`] order, then buffer pages in issue order,
//! and the fetcher waits whenever the buffer's scans on disk reach
//! [`Options::buffer_cap`], looking again every minute.
//!
//! **Layout**: `<out>/<set>/<batch>/<lccn>/<date>/<edition>/<seq>.<ext>`
//! (`<set>` is `keep` or `buffer`, so nothing that empties the buffer can
//! reach a keep scan), where
//! `<ext>` is `jp2` for a full scan fetched through its batch (the original
//! JP2, checked against the bag's md5), `jpg` for a full scan fetched as
//! the IIIF JPEG (before #368's batch route, or through the item API when
//! the batch route can't place the page) and `pct<n>.jpg` for one scaled
//! to n%, with a sidecar `<file>.json` ([`Sidecar`]) holding the LoC URL,
//! the IIIF base, the fetch time, the size, the sha256 and, for a JP2, the
//! bag's md5. The scan is written to a `.part`
//! file, synced and renamed, then the sidecar the same way, so a scan
//! counts only once its sidecar is there. Each fetch is also appended to
//! `<out>/index-<tag>.jsonl`, and each failure to `<out>/failures-<tag>.jsonl`
//! (`<tag>` is `full` or `pct<n>`).
//!
//! **Resuming**: a page whose scan and sidecar are there, in either format,
//! with the size, sha256 and (if recorded) md5 the sidecar records, is
//! skipped; anything else is fetched again. The JPEGs fetched before the
//! batch route stay valid and aren't fetched again as JP2s.
//!
//! **Status**: `<out>/status-<tag>.json` ([`Status`]), rewritten every
//! [`Options::progress_every`] pages and every 30 s, with a log line
//! (JSON on stdout, so journald under systemd) at each one. Logs name
//! pages by doc_id.
