//! The on-prem OCR worker (#296): takes pages from Azure Storage Queues,
//! fetches their scans from LoC, reads them with a local OCR engine and
//! writes ALTO and an overlay part to the exchange storage account. It holds
//! no LoC text and makes no keep-or-drop decision; a cloud job checks the
//! parts and the release decides.
