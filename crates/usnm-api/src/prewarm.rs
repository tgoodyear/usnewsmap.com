//! Cache warm-up before a version serves (06 §6.5).
//!
//! The first search against a cold index can take longer than the request
//! timeout, so before a replica serves a version (at start, and before a
//! reload swaps a new one in) it runs what the site's first visitors load:
//! the places layer, and each example search from the home page with the
//! coverage cube its response links to; then, with what is left of the
//! budget, the searches visitors made most often recently, read from the
//! search log (06 §6.8), each with its coverage cube. The requests go through
//! the same handlers as visitors' requests, pinned to the new version, so the
//! search engine's caches and the response caches (in-process, and the
//! persistent cache for slow ones) hold exactly the entries those visitors
//! will ask for.
//!
//! The examples run in the order visitors pick them: those searched most in
//! the search log first, then the rest in the file's order (the home page
//! shows them in a random order per visit, so no order of its own comes
//! first).
//!
//! After a start, a search whose response a cache already holds (the
//! persistent cache, filled by an earlier warm-up or a visitor) is only read
//! into the in-process cache, [`LOADS_AT_ONCE`] at a time: that needs no
//! search. Only the misses are computed. Before a publish nothing is cached
//! for the new version yet, and the run computes every search, which warms
//! the search engine's caches for it too.
//!
//! Computations run one at a time on the warm-up's own slot: searches are
//! CPU-bound, and on a 2-vCPU searcher two at once each took twice as long
//! (06 §6.5). After a start, a computation waits while every visitor slot is
//! taken, so the warm-up doesn't add a third search to visitors' two. Each
//! has `config.prewarm_query_timeout` (the searcher's own limit per call
//! still applies), all within `config.prewarm_budget` before a publish, or
//! `config.prewarm_startup_budget` after a start. Nothing here fails: a
//! warm-up that times out or errors is logged and the version serves anyway.
//!
//! Searches from the log are logged by rank only (`search-log-3`), never by
//! their text, and their errors by kind only: an error message can quote
//! the query.
