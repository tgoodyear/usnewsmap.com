//! The Quickwit searcher sidecar's cache, thread pool and runtime metrics,
//! reported as the API's own (#125, #251, 08 §8.1.2, 08 §8.4).
//!
//! The sidecar listens on localhost only, and its storage is reachable only
//! inside the network, so its Prometheus endpoint can't be read from
//! outside. Every `USNM_SEARCHER_METRICS_SECS` (60 s by default; 0 turns it
//! off) the API reads it and reports, for the split footer, fast field,
//! partial request and predicate caches (`cache`: `split_footer`,
//! `fast_field`, `partial_request`, `predicate`):
//!
//! - `api.searcher_cache_bytes` and `api.searcher_cache_items`: what the
//!   cache holds now (gauges). Recorded when they change, and at least every
//!   [`HEARTBEAT`] so a quiet replica still reports them.
//! - `api.searcher_cache_hits`, `api.searcher_cache_misses` and
//!   `api.searcher_cache_evictions`: what happened since the last scrape
//!   (counters), recorded only when not zero. The first scrape reports
//!   everything since the searcher started, which in a fresh replica is the
//!   warm-up. A restarted searcher starts every counter from 0, so if any
//!   counter of any cache or runtime went down (or a cache or runtime
//!   disappeared), every new value is what happened since.
//!
//! For the thread pools and Tokio runtimes, so a cold search waiting on the
//! search pool's cores can be told from one waiting on downloads (#251), it
//! reports:
//!
//! - `api.searcher_pool_tasks`: the tasks the `search` and `small_tasks`
//!   thread pools (`pool`) are running and have queued (`state`: `ongoing`,
//!   `pending`) at the scrape (a gauge). Recorded for both pools at every
//!   scrape, 0 included, also before Quickwit has used a pool: a snapshot of
//!   an idle pool says as much as a busy one.
//! - `api.searcher_runtime_threads`: the worker threads of each Tokio
//!   runtime (`runtime`: `main`; `blocking` and `non_blocking` once Quickwit
//!   starts them), a gauge recorded at every scrape.
//! - `api.searcher_runtime_busy_ms`: how long those threads were busy since
//!   the last scrape, summed over them (a counter, recorded only when not
//!   zero), and `api.searcher_runtime_capacity_ms`: the thread time they had
//!   in the same span, threads times the time since the last scrape (a
//!   counter). Busy over capacity, summed over any span, is the runtime's
//!   busy share, however the reports fall into it. Both need the last
//!   scrape of the same searcher run, so neither is recorded at the first
//!   scrape or right after a restart, when the busy time covers the
//!   searcher's whole life. The main runtime does the searcher's downloads
//!   and opens the splits.
//!
//! Whether the split footer cache holds every footer is read from two
//! things together: the release's footer total (`footer_bytes` on its
//! `index layout` lines) against `split_footer_cache_capacity`, and whether
//! footer misses and evictions keep coming after the warm-up. An eviction on
//! its own proves nothing: Quickwit 0.9.1 also counts replacing an entry as
//! one, and after a publish the cache drops the old version's footers. The
//! first footer eviction a searcher run shows is logged once, without a
//! cause.
//!
//! A scrape that fails (the sidecar starting, restarting or gone) records
//! nothing. The first failure in a row is logged once, and the recovery once.
