//! The anonymous search log (06 §6.8, ADR-0012).
//!
//! Every search a visitor runs on the site is kept, indefinitely, in the
//! `searches` container as one line of JSON ([`Record`]): the words, the
//! match mode and filters, the number of pages matched, the index version
//! and the UTC day. Nothing that identifies or links a person is stored
//! with it: no address, user agent, referrer, cookie, request or session id,
//! location, or time of day.
//!
//! A search counts once, on `/v1/aggregate`, which the site requests once
//! per search; the coverage and hits requests that follow aren't counted.
//! It counts when the response is a 200, from a cache or not. Not counted
//! ([`admit`]): the warm-up's queries (they don't pass through the handler),
//! requests with `DNT: 1` or `Sec-GPC: 1`, crawler, script and headless user
//! agents, and requests that don't come from the site's own pages.
//!
//! The handler hands a record to a bounded queue and never waits: when the
//! queue is full the record is dropped and counted. A background task
//! batches the records and, every `flush_interval` and at shutdown, writes
//! each day's batch in random order to its own blob,
//! `staging/{day}/{random id}.jsonl`, create-only. A failed write is retried
//! under the same name, so a write that succeeded without the API hearing
//! back isn't stored twice. Records for a day that still aren't staged
//! [`STAGE_UNTIL`] after it ends are dropped. [`CLOSE_AFTER`] after a day
//! ends, a replica lists that day's staged batches, shuffles all of their
//! lines together and writes them once to `days/{day}.jsonl`, which is never
//! rewritten. A lifecycle rule deletes staged batches after
//! [`STAGING_DAYS`] days. So the permanent file's line order says nothing
//! about when in the day a search ran, and the only time a record carries is
//! its day.
//!
//! Search text never goes to the console or to telemetry, write errors
//! included: errors name the blob path (`staging/2026-09-29/….jsonl`) and the
//! number of records, never their content.
