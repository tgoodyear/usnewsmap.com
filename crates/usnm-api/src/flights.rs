//! Response computations in flight (06 §6.5).
//!
//! A response the in-process cache doesn't hold is computed by a task of
//! its own, not by the request that asked for it, so a slow search keeps
//! going after its visitor stops waiting (the visitor gets `202 Accepted`
//! and asks again). Identical requests share one computation: the first
//! registers it here under its cache key, and the others wait on the same
//! result. When the computation ends, its task stores a successful body in
//! the in-process cache and only then removes the entry, so a request finds
//! either the computation or its result, never neither. Errors, timeouts
//! included, are handed to whoever is waiting and never cached.
//!
//! A search takes one of `compute_concurrency` slots for as long as it
//! runs, after its persistent-cache read misses, which bounds how many run
//! at once. When every slot is taken it joins a first-come, first-served
//! queue of at most `search_queue` searches and keeps its place there for
//! as long as someone keeps asking about it; a `202` says how many searches
//! are ahead of it. A search that finds the queue full is refused at once
//! as busy. A computation that nobody has waited on for `abandon_after`
//! (15 s) is cancelled, so a visitor who changes the search or leaves frees
//! its slot or its place in the queue. The warm-up has a slot of its own.
