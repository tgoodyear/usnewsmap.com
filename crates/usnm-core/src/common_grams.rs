//! Common-word pairs (05 §5.5.3): a second copy of a page's words, in the
//! index field `text_cg`, where each common word is joined to the word after
//! it (`of` before `gold` is `of_gold`). A phrase holding a common word is
//! searched there instead of in `text`, so the engine never reads the
//! positions of the common word itself, which is on almost every page: over
//! 1896, the phrase "cross of gold" took 41 s in `text` and `cross gold`
//! within 2 words 9 s (06 §6.5).
//!
//! The field has the same positions as `text`: one token per word. A word
//! the analyzer drops (longer than [`MAX_TOKEN_CHARS`]) keeps its position
//! as [`GAP`]. A common word's token holds the next word's, so a phrase whose
//! words map through [`query_terms`] matches at a position in `text_cg`
//! exactly when the words are at that position in `text`: a non-common word
//! is its own token, and a common one checks the word after it as well.
//! Only the last word of the phrase has no word after it to check, so a
//! phrase ending in a common word stays on `text`.
//!
//! The list and the token rules are part of the index: a version of them
//! is [`VERSION`], recorded in `current.json`'s `common_grams`. Every index
//! of a published version has the pairs at one version: a delta is built at
//! the published version's ([`analyzer`]), and only a full rebuild moves to
//! [`VERSION`] (`usnm-ingest`). The API searches `text_cg` when it knows the
//! published version's, and parses queries with its [`Analyzer`].
