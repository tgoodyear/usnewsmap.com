# Word lists in usnm-core

Data files compiled into `usnm-core`. The crate's code is MIT; these files keep the licences of the data they come from, and `Cargo.toml` names both.

`ja-ocr/wordlists/README.md` describes how the Hawaiian and Yiddish lists were built.

## The damage word lists

One file per word list code in `usnm_core::lang` (wordfreq's codes: `sh` serves Croatian and Serbian, `nb` Norwegian, `fil` Tagalog). Each holds the language's 5,000 most frequent words, most frequent first, one per line, exactly as wordfreq 3.1.1's `top_n_list` returns them (the same call `ja-ocr/quality.py` makes). Order matters: the metric takes its function words and head words from the front of the list.

Rebuild or check them with wordfreq 3.1.1 installed (`pip install wordfreq==3.1.1`):

```sh
scripts/build-damage-words.py --check
scripts/build-damage-words.py --out-dir crates/usnm-core/data/damage-words
```

Nothing in the pipeline runs the script; the files are committed data.

## The page-language word lists

`page-language-words.txt` holds each word list's function words: its 100 most frequent words of 2 letters or more, most frequent first, then for Danish and Norwegian their `aa` spellings (`paa` for `på`). One line per list: the list's code, the script of its words, then the words. The script builds it from `ja-ocr/damage_v2.py`'s own models, so the words are the ones the OCR audit finds a page's language by. It is about 18 KB, and every binary that uses `usnm_core::page_language` embeds it; the damage lists stay behind the `damage` feature. It is derived from the wordfreq lists and from our Hawaiian (CC0) and Yiddish (CC BY-SA 4.0) lists, so it is shared under CC BY-SA 4.0, as its header says.

Rebuild or check it with wordfreq 3.1.1 installed:

```sh
scripts/build-page-language-words.py --check
scripts/build-page-language-words.py
```

The Japanese OCR image's tests run the same check (`ja-ocr/test_page_language_parity.py`).
