//! The `index` stage (04 §4.4, 08 §8.4.1): build a new sealed index and the
//! reference snapshot that goes with it, then publish both by writing
//! `current.json` last.
//!
//! - **Incremental:** batches curated since the published version go into a
//!   new delta index; the version lists base + deltas + the new delta.
//! - **Full** (compaction): every curated batch goes into a new base index.
//!   Also forced when there is no published version or it already has 8
//!   deltas. Replacements (new batch versions) and catalog changes to
//!   published titles, a move to another place included, take effect only
//!   here (04 §4.7); a published place's corrected name or point rides the
//!   next delta (04 §4.6).
//!
//! A Quickwit index is merged into a few large splits and closed before it
//! is published (`crate::merges`); the version's manifest records the
//! splits of each of its indexes.
//!
//! A curated batch whose titles aren't all in the catalog yet waits for a
//! later release (it counts as new until it's published): `titles-sync` is
//! paced and stops on LoC's rate limit, and a backlog of titles shouldn't
//! hold up the batches that are ready.
//!
//! The Cosmos `ops/quickwit-writer` lock makes this the only writer. Indexes
//! are never rewritten: a failed run leaves an unpublished index for the
//! janitor, and the retry builds a new one.
