//! Merging a new index before it is published (05 §5.5.1, 08 §8.4.1).
//!
//! Every cold search opens each split of the indexes it names, so a sealed
//! index should be a few large splits, not the hundreds the writer cuts
//! while it ingests. The writer node merges them in the background; the
//! release waits for it in two steps before it publishes:
//!
//! 1. **Settle:** with the index still open, until the merge planner has
//!    nothing running or queued and the split list has stopped changing.
//! 2. **Finalize:** the index's ingest source is disabled, which shuts its
//!    merge pipeline down; on the way out, the merge policy merges the small
//!    splits that are left (`max_finalize_merge_operations`). The release
//!    waits for the pipeline to finish and the splits to settle again.
//!
//! Quickwit 0.9.1 doesn't restart a merge pipeline that fails once it has
//! been told to stop, and its uploader can fail a merge: to move the merged
//! split into its local cache, it measures the merge's scratch folder while
//! the merge executor deletes the input splits it downloaded there, and a
//! folder that disappears between the listing and its size fails the upload
//! ("No such file or directory"). The pipeline then never finishes its final
//! merges and the splits never change (issue #84). The release watches the writer's output for that, and for a
//! node that stays idle without finishing, and runs the final merges again:
//! it re-enables the source, sends one document the index's strict mapping
//! rejects (so a source whose shards were closed and deleted gets a new,
//! empty one and Quickwit starts its pipelines), waits for the new merge
//! pipeline, and disables the source again. A new pipeline reads the index's
//! unmerged splits from the metastore. After three tries the release fails.
//!
//! The wait is bounded, and the result is checked: the splits must hold
//! exactly the documents sent, and no more of them than the merge policy
//! leaves. The writer's output is watched for a full disk and for failed
//! merges; either stops the release, so nothing is published half merged.
