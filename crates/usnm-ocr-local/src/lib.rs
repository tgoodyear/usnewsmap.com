//! Our own OCR of pages LoC read badly, from the on-prem nodes into the
//! lake (#296, 12 §12.5 Steps 8 and 10): `usnm-ingest ocr-sync`,
//! `ocr-enqueue`, `ocr-requeue` and the seeder ([`seed`], `ocr-seed`).
//!
//! The crate also holds what the seeder, `ocr-sync` and `ocr-enqueue` read
//! first: the damage tables of Step 6 ([`ocr_damage`], `usnm-ingest
//! ocr-damage`) and the prefetch manifest built from them ([`ocr_prefetch`],
//! `usnm-ingest ocr-prefetch-manifest`). The `usnm-ingest` binary runs all of
//! these commands and hands the seeder what it takes from the rest of the
//! pipeline ([`seed::AmericanStories`]).
//!
//! The nodes write to the exchange account's `ocr-out` and `ocr-deadletter`
//! (ADR-0015). Everything there is untrusted: any member of the nodes'
//! group can write or overwrite any blob in `ocr-out` and put any message
//! of up to 64 KiB on `ocr-deadletter`. `ocr-sync` checks each part, its
//! ALTO and each dead letter ([`checks`]), copies what passes into the
//! curated store under `ocr-local/`, moves what fails to the exchange
//! account's `ocr-quarantine` with a reason record that holds no content
//! ([`quarantine`]), and deletes the sources with If-Match on the ETags it
//! read, so it only ever writes the bytes it checked.
//!
//! Layout in the curated store (the `curated` container):
//!
//! - `ocr-local/alto/<doc_id>.<node>.<stamp>.xml`: each imported page's
//!   ALTO, as the node wrote it.
//! - `ocr-local/pages/<lccn>/<run>.parquet`: one create-only part per title
//!   and import: the 16 overlay columns ([`usnm_overlay::schema`]) plus
//!   where the row came from and both texts' scores ([`pages`]).
//! - `ocr-local/import/<run>.json`: each import's record, listing the
//!   sources it consumed with their ETags; a run that stops before deleting
//!   them leaves them for the next run, which finds them here and deletes
//!   them without importing them again.
//! - `ocr-local/queued/<day>/<run>.parquet` and
//!   `ocr-local/outcomes/<day>/<run>.parquet`: the ledger ([`ledger`]).
//! - `ocr-local/seed/rank/<key>/<batch>_verNN.json` and
//!   `ocr-local/seed/plans/<plan>/done/<run>.json`: the seeder's ranked
//!   units and each plan's finished ones ([`seed`]).
//! - `ocr-local/deadletter/<day>/<run>.jsonl`: drained dead letters,
//!   re-encoded from their checked fields.
//! - `ocr-local/report/<stamp>.json`: `ocr-sync --report` ([`report`]).
//! - `ocr-local/revoked/<stamp>.json`: rows the release leaves out, by node,
//!   engine, import run or time ([`replace::Revocation`]), written by hand.
//!
//! The release (`--ocr-local`, Step 9) reads the merged parts batch by batch
//! and gives a page our text in place of LoC's where rule v1 ([`rule`])
//! prefers it ([`replace`]).
//!
//! The reference store gets `status/ocr-local.json` ([`sync::Status`]).
//! Logs carry page ids, paths, counts and reason codes, never text.
