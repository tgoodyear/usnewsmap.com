// Alerts on the public API and site (09 §9.2), email through the
// environment's action group. Deployed with the API when alert emails are
// set.
//
// - API 5xx, aggregate latency and slow searches: log search alerts on the workspace,
//   reading what usnm-api exports to Application Insights: requests
//   (AppRequests, one row per request except the health probes; the
//   request name is "<method> <route template>") and, for slow searches,
//   the api.slow_searches metric (AppMetrics). Stateful: one
//   notification when a condition starts, resolved when it clears. Each
//   splits by a column or two (dimensions) that the email lists: a kind and
//   the route or endpoint with the most of it. Route names are templates
//   ("GET /v1/aggregate"), never paths or query strings, so no search text.
//   Every combination is its own alert, so a second route overtaking the
//   first during an incident sends one more email.
// - Availability: an Application Insights standard test of the site's home
//   page from three US locations, with a metric alert when two of the three
//   fail. The site and the API are one container app, so the home page
//   exercises DNS, TLS, ingress and the app; /readyz is already probed by
//   Container Apps and failing searches raise the 5xx alert. Only when the
//   site's hostname has a bound certificate (the test checks TLS). Results are written by the
//   availability service itself; the component's DisableLocalAuth only
//   restricts what clients send, and Microsoft's list of scenarios that
//   don't work with Entra-only ingestion doesn't include availability tests.
//   Each run is billed ($0.0005 per location per run in East US 2): every
//   15 minutes from 3 locations is about $4 a month.
