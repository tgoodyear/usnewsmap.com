// Data lake account (08 §8.1): flat namespace so versioning and soft delete
// work, Entra ID only (no keys or SAS), private endpoint only in steady state.
//
// With allowedIps (the on-prem Serial Set runner, ADR-0008 amendment of
// October 2026), public network access is on, and the firewall denies
// everything but those addresses: the operator's home IP, from
// USNM_OCR_NODE_IPS, never in the repository. The private endpoint stays,
// and the Container Apps keep using it. No trusted-service bypass. The
// public-network policy exempts the account by resource id only while it is
// open (main.bicep, public-accounts.bicep).
//
// With subnetIds and no private endpoint (a cold spare, ADR-0008 amendment of
// November 2026), the Container Apps reach the account from those subnets
// through a service endpoint, behind the same deny-by-default firewall, and
// Entra ID stays the only way in.
