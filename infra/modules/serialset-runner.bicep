// The on-prem Serial Set runner's access to the data lake (#229, ADR-0008
// amendment of October 2026): `usnm-ingest congress-serialset` run on an OCR
// node, as that node's Arc machine identity, in place of the Azure job.
//
// One grant: a custom role with blob read and write data actions and no
// control-plane actions (Storage Blob Data Contributor would also let it
// delete or reconfigure the container, which a condition can't restrict),
// on the curated container, with a condition that leaves it only what the
// fetch does there, all of it under congress/serialset/:
// - list, with a prefix under congress/serialset/ (the fetch lists only its
//   own series, congress/curated.rs finished_in and empties_in);
// - read, write and create blobs whose path is under congress/serialset/
//   (counts.json, the parquet parts and empty.json, all create-only);
// - no delete and no move, anywhere: the role has neither data action. (A
//   condition can't say so again: Azure refuses a condition that names an
//   action the role doesn't grant, InvalidRoleAssignmentCondition.)
// Nothing on the other containers, and nothing on Cosmos: the runner holds
// its lock in a local state file (docs/operations/congress-pages.md, "The Serial Set
// on-prem").
